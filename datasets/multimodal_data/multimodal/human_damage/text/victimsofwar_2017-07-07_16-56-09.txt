Can life ever be the same again?
For someone who has seen so much war?
So much horror,
So much crying,
In the ruins desperate hiding
Listen to the sounds of dying
Everyday.
And I want to be able to help them
By any means except praying,
Because it was religion that started all this shit in the first place.
