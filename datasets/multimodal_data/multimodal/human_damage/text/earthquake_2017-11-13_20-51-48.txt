A 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit the Iran/Iraq border. There are, until now, more than 400 people dead and thousands of injured. There were also 2 other earthquakes, but not as strong, in Japan and Costa Rica. So, whoever is the God you pray to... just pray for the people affected. I hope that our friends are all safe, specially our Iranian friends.
