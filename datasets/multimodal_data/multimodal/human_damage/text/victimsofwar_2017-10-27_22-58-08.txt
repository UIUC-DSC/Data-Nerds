Hot water for dinner as starvation worsens in besieged Syrian town💔😢🙏 Hamouria – Manal boils water on the stove in the besieged Syrian town of Hamouria, hoping to convince her four children that she is cooking, but she has no food.
She puts the pot on the flame as a ruse, waiting for the children to fall asleep in the dilapidated house before they realise there is nothing for dinner...
With no new access for food, medicine and humanitarian aid the situation worsens.Basic services for the region’s estimated 400 000 residents are virtually non-existent, with electricity produced only by generators and the water available often dirty and a vector for illness.
