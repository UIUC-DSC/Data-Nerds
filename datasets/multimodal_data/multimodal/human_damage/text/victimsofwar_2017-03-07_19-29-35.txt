I didn't rate this picture at the time I took it but I make no apologies for posting it now, .I have just spent 15 minutes looking into this poor girls face in high 24 megapixel definition as I edited it ready to go to a library it's hard to miss the overwhelming look of despair in the one remaining eye of this young woman. This is the face of war and the victims who suffer because of it. She is about 19 and has lost her right eye and arm in a coalition air strike on her home in the outskirts of Mosul, according to a man who said he was her uncle. This may or may not be true, but what she will need is an operation to repair her smashed eye socket that she won't be able to get in iraq . #photography #photojournalism #war #warphotography #warphotographer #warphoto #mosuloffensive #refugees #warvictim #kurdistan #warvictims #realworld #victimsofwar #fujifilm #fujixt2 #fujifilm_uk #fujifilm_xseries #fujifilm #everydaypeople #mosul #everyday #realpeople #reallives #repostmyfuji
