@Regrann from @flavamatik: So my big sister sent me an email with this image. She was dead worried since the last time she spoke with me I was trapped by the rains at Osu and I've been dodging her calls since. 
I didn't pay attention to the email because this picture made me think about life. 
To everyone who lost someone , have faith and lets pray and hope they find peace in a better place.
