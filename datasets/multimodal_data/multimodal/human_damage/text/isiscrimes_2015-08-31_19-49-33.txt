This is indeed a picture to most people but to the Syrian people it is a sad reality that they face everyday. #assadcrimes #assadholocaust #isiscrimes #genocide #syriangenocide #shameonhumanity #shameonthisworld #sad#pain #poor #postcard #postcardfromsyria #unitednations #un#untilwhen#orphans #syrianorphans #syrianchildren #syrianchild #injured#syria#syrie#syrians
