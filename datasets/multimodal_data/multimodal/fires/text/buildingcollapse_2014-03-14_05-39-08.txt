I've never been this close to a site of such enormous devastation. It's puts things into powerful perspective and focus, and makes me that much more appreciative of the selfless work and dedication of the FDNY, as well as the NYPD. Our city's bravest and finest have shown tremendous grace under pressure, and my respect and admiration for the work they do grows by the minute. #eastharlem #buildingcollapse #nyc #harlem #elbarrio
