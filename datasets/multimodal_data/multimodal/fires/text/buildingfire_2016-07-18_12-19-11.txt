A hotel in Makkah's Azaziya neighbourhood caught fire on Sunday, sending plumes of smoke over the area as firefighters worked for hours to extinguish the flames that engulfed the 10-storey building.

According to the Saudi Press Agency, SPA, a spokesperson said in a statement that palm trees outside the hotel caught fire and flames from the fronds rapidly reached the building's upper floors. He did not indicate how the trees caught fire or name the hotel.#fire #buildingfire #firefire #flames #makkah #makkahfire #instagrammersgallery #instagram #instaphoto #instafire #instagrammersgallery #fire
