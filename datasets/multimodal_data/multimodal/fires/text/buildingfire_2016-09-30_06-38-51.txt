TABER FIRE DEPARTMENT ON SCENE OF AN OLD VIDEO STORE FIRE IN BARNWELL, ALBERTA. NOT SURE WHAT UNITS WERE ON SCENE CAUSE THIS PHOTO IS FROM ONE OF MY BUDDIES WHO ISNT ON INSTAGRAM. BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE ENGINE 6-3 WAS THERE AS I CAN TELL FROM THE SHAPE AMD LIGHTS OF THE TRUCK. I ALSO KNOW ALBERTA HEALTH SERVICES AMBULANCE WAS ON SCENE
