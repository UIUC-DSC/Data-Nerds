Well,there goes the neighbourhood... Lost everything.. Still not under control but me and my family are safe. I will never forget the terror of today. Literally driving through flames.. So scary, but so very thankful to God were alive. #fire #fortmcmurray #lost #gone #flames #terror #scared #heartbroken #crazy #help #forrestfire #wildfire #everythinggone #besafe
