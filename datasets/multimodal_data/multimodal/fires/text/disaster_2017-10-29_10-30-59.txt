I remember during my first visit to Vietnam 15 years ago, my grandfather came to my uncle's shop and he told me that there was a large fire and many people were dead in Saigon. Later I watched midday news on VTV1 and the news video report shows a large fire at the building called Trung tâm Thương mại Quốc tế ITC. It made big headlines in Vietnam. 60 people killed in the huge fire and it was Vietnam's worst fire disaster. The event made me and the people of Saigon hard to forget. I also remember when I was in Saigon, my grandfather took me to the scene where it happened. The building was located in the heart of Saigon, just near Ben Thanh Market and opposite to Saigon Centre.
