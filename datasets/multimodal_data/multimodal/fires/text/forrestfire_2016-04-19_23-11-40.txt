ğŸ’– Firefighters ğŸ’–
This happening now near Fort St.John BC. Canada. Forrest fire season has started in North America. Pretty early this time of year. Usually mid May this happens. May God protect All the Firefighters around the world as they start to battle against raging fires. May you all be Blessed with strength and courage and peace knowing you are protecting not just wild life but all life. May you all be brought home safely. I am so Proud of you all ğŸ˜‡ğŸ’– You firefighters are Awesome and so Loved and appreciated by not just your families but by Everyone. I appreciate you and Thank you for your time ğŸ’œ I Love you all ğŸ’–
