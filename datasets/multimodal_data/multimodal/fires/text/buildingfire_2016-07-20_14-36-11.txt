Glowing tin on the side of a garden shed at a fire we fought earlier this year. Fires with significant fuel loads output a lot of heat energy, and develop very quickly. Temperatures in this garden shed alone were upwards of 500 degrees Celsius when we first arrived, fuelled by an adjoining building, packed with numerous types of fuels and chemicals. Our first priority is always to protect exposures, and to work our way from the area of least damage, so as to prevent further fire spread and subsequent damage. Concentrating on the area that's burning the most isn't always the smartest way to tackle a decent sized fire.
