After the tragic events of last night at the GrenFell Towers,  as a small part of the community we are trying to bring the people of London, as well as people around the world together and to help raise money and resources for the people that suffered terrible losses from last night. We aim to start here and to then expand our organisation to be able to help the millions that are also suffering around the world such as children in Africa/Afghanistan/Bangladesh/Palestine to just mention. So please as a the people of London and of this world, lets help to make this world a much better and safer for us and the future population to come to live in! üôåüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Click the link in the bio to donate and to help make a difference for the better in these people's lives! Thank You!
