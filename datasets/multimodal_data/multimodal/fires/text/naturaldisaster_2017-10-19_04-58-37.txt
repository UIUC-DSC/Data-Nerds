#CaliforniaFires2017 (@theweednerd420 Repost) 20 lb charity garden burned to the ground as well as homes and other gardens • •  I Just wanted to say
I hope everyone up north can start getting the fire contained. This drought has been a disaster for the whole state of #California. I don’t know what I would do if my whole house, garden, charity gardens and all sentimental value is gone for good. Yeah that’s painful and don’t get me wrong it’s a loss of bud but we can always grow. @subcool420 as well as countless others are all in need of some good cannabis community support. Will try to find links to donate or something, anything. I say we show support, regardless of all of the differences we have with each other I know one thing, the community works really well when we put aside our differences and we look at one another as an equal. Sorry, I just hate to see this happen,
love and most of all empathy to those in and around the fires as well as the rest of the world going through any other disasters of sorts #norcalfires #norcal #fireservice #mendocino #mendocinocounty #mmj #cannabiscommunity #fire #califirefighters #humboldtcounty #allofnorcal 🙏🏻✊🏻 hope everyone is safe and accounted for. #naturaldisaster #californiadrought causes more damage than we realize. Just wanted to raise a little awareness of the situation.
