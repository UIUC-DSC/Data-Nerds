4 alarm fire on October 31, 2016. This was an apartment building under construction in a high density area. Crews were challenged with the amount of fire on arrival and the close proximity of occupied exposure buildings. Exposure buildings had limited damage due the aggressive and strategic placement of hose lines by your Oakland Firefighters. #oakland #fire #buildingfire #4alarm @chief_miller #structurefire #busy #local55 #firefighter
