This is my PicMix imagine for today. I live just north of the Soberanes Fire which is happening now in Northern California. There are over 5,000 fire fighters fighting this fire. My son is a fire fighter but he is not fighting this specific fire but has fought many. There is a lot of smoke everywhere now. As a Christian I continue to pray for those who lost their homes by fire and our brave fire fighters.
