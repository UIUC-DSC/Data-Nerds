Yemen is one of the world's poorest and least developed nations. Traditionally neglected, almost half the country's residents are malnourished and have no access to clean water. Since March 19th hundreds of people have been killed and injured, including children. Hospitals are struggling to cope, shops have closed, water and electricity supplies have been cut off, tens of thousands of people have fled their homes, and much higher levels of displacement are anticipated. The humanitarian situation is heading for catastrophe. An estimated 15 million people - almost two-thirds of the population - need humanitarian assistance. The humanitarian situation is heading for catastrophe. Women and children in Yemen today are displaced and hungry. It is our duty to come to their aid and support them with that which Allah has granted us. Donate whatever you can for the sake of Allah.
