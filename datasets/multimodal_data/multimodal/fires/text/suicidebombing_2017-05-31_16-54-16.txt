Isn't better to die once than everyday?

First of all being the real and historic neighbor of #Afghanistan we the people from #OccupiedBalochistan condemn Pakistan's terror attack on innocent women, children and people in the month of holly #Ramadan in strongest possible terms. 
We extend our sincere and deepest condolences to the brave people of #Afghanistan who have equally victims of Pakistani terrorism. We feel the pain equally because #Balochistan and #Afghanistan are two eyes of one body. 
We are very sad that still people in #Afghan government lending friendship hand towards #ISI which never forgive its own people. How they will forgive #Afghanistan? 
Two days before all the Scholars of Panjab #Lahore #Islamabad unanimously issued a #Fatwa terming the #Jihad,  #SuicideBombings as #Harram but today when they themselves conducting #SuicideBombing in #Kabul in the month of #RAMADAN none of these Panjabi Mullahs and #Muftis utter a single world against such inhuman acts by #ISI. 
Afghanistan government thinks if it helps to liberate #Balochistan and #Pashtunistna people #Pakistan #ISI will be unhappy?

Well for decades #ISI is killing your innocent women, children and countrymen if you support to #Liberate #Balochistan #Pashtunistan believe me the genocide of #BalochAfghan will stop forever. 
Bangladesh sacrificed 3 million #Bangali and today they are an independent State in 1971.

If Afghanistan could supported #FreeBalochistan movement during 1980 today there were no bomb blasts, suicide bombing on Afghan women and children because #NoPaksitanNoProblem.

#Afghanistan must come with courage to support #FreeBalochPashtunState to stop Pakistani terrorism forever. Isn't better to die once than everyday?
