My heart aches for all the people affected by the nation's fires this season - both close to home and far away. The harrowing stories of the first responders and volunteers who put their lives in danger to save lives and homes are truly inspiring. And the stories from the victims gives me goosebumps (6 hours in a bone chilling pool to survive while everything around you melts?! Really?! And Izzy??? 😭).

On a personal note, it's been saddening to see many places I have found solace in over the years go up in flames. It wasn't until this last weekend that we smelled what typically is a happy campfire scent along our hike that it became real. After we got back to the trailhead under the aid of our headlamps and started the journey home in the dark, we saw miles of hillside lit up in flames along this FS road. While this one is "contained" it is truly eery to see entire hillsides ablaze, trees burning and the ground smoldering. //
Sending good thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by these crazy natural (and unfortunately some manmade) disasters. ✌🏽❤️🙏🏽
