Fuck you fire. We never thought such a thing would happen here, but it's a terror that was our reality. Although it took many homes, jobs, loved ones, and continues to do so, it didn't take our love. I'm so thankful my family and friends are okay, and for my friends whom opened their arms and shelter to us. I'm still so uneasy not being able to go home, but I'm glad im still here and breathing. To everyone I know who lost their home or workplace, I am sorry you were so affected. I love you all, let me know how I can help. And to those who still have a home but can't go to it, hang in there friends. ‚ù§
