My heart is breaking - our beautiful mountains are on fire. We got rain last night, but not nearly enough. We had a new fire pop up in the mountains yesterday. Thanks to drought conditions and high winds, it is wreaking havoc on a section that brings in a lot of tourists (Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge). We need rain. We need prayers. We need stupid people to stop lighting fires. They've destroyed an entire town!!! Please, God, make it stop!!! .
