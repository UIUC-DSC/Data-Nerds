🙏 going 🆙 for everybody in the area.  Glad to know that my ppl are safe and sound up that way. I was just there a few months ago celebrating my birthday. It has become one of my favorite lil getaway spots over the past couple of years and its so sad to see it in this state of emergency 😱😥 #prayers #gatlinburgtennessee #drought #forrestfire
