DAY 13 #EstivalSurvey - Back to Anchorage, Alaska

Even for a wordy SOB like me, it's hard to explain what we've been through the last 48 hours. We should've known camping next to a rusty torpedo that was attached to a dead tree like a gargoyle to an old church would be a sign of treachery to come. Still, we have managed to endure the smoke and flames of forrest fires, both figurative and literal, and we've rendezvoused with our crew in Anchorage along with our hot air balloon pilot, Mike. 
Tonight at 10:30 pm, we take flight.
