Does anyone who lives around 635 & Centerville/Ferguson Road remember this? Throwback from 2010, I remember sleeping in bed in these same apartments when all of a sudden my mom wakes me up at 2:00 a.m. and said, an apartment is on fire! I ran outside on the balcony to see all of building E burning. Everybody including the neighbors came out: Dallas firefighters from different stations, news, even the Red Cross. I ran to building D across the parking lot to watch upclose as the top two floors of the building collapsed. It was scary and the next day came. When I left for school, it was just the first floor remained but when I came home, it was nothing but a big pile of rubble surrounded by a fence for safety. I remember on the news that residents on the 3rd floor jumped to evacuate the building.
