"For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." - 2 Corinthians 5:1.

I don't know why these things happen: forest fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados.. but I do know that this is our temporary home. I know that possessions are material items that can be replaced, and I pray for faith in that fact during times like these. I pray for understanding. Our beautiful state is engulfed in flames. The hikes and memories Heather and I have made since moving here are now even more precious and priceless. The fires are getting closer. Our schools aren't having recess due to the air quality and ash. Over 10,000 acres now. We're asking for prayers over Portland. We're asking for prayers over Houston, Florida, Idaho, Montana, & Utah. .
