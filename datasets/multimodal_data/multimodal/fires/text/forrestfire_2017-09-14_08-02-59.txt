View of the Eagle Creek fire at Herman Creek from Carson Washington.
Completely heartbreaking watching this fire make its way through the Gorge.  Every time we think it's settling it switches into high gear again.  Some much loss and hurt for the folks in this area as homes and livelihoods are threatened.  My head says the Gorge will survive; my heart breaks for the Gorge I knew.
