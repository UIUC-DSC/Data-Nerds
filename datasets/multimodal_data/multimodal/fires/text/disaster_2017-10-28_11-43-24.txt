"I'm on fire", and this is not a song.
#RegionePiemonte is surrounded by kilometers of fire. Flames are destroying thounsands of plants, killing animals, burning houses.
My sister is out of home, displaced with her children for the risk near #Pinerolo. Some friends of mine are seeing their ground in #ValdiSusa burning.
Almost ten days of fire and we aren't able to stop it!!?!!
Can the fire reach the city? What can we do to not to be passive?
The air is unbreathable. Medias are talking about that just a little, not enought. I need to do something.
