Wealth and poverty sit side by side in Grenfell Tower's borough

Data shows area around Grenfell Tower was among top 10% most deprived areas in England in 2015
From the top floors of the 24-storey Grenfell Tower, residents could see out across Kensington and Chelsea, one of the wealthiest local authorities in the country. Yet the tower and its residents were situated in one of the most deprived areas in England.
The borough is among Londonâ€™s most unequal, with extreme poverty and wealth living side by side. Data shows that the vicinity of the tower was among the top 10% most deprived areas in England in 2015, ranking alongside parts of Bradford and south Tyneside.
