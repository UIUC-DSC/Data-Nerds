Triangle Shirt Factory Fire 
Safety was also a major concern Industrial work was very unsafe particularly the rail roads. Before the invention of the air brake trains employed men known as brakemen who job was ride on the top of the train and unscrew a mechanical wheel that unlocked braked by hand. It was a risky job because weâ€™re shaken off the trains by rough tracks, steep bends and bridges. There are a number of accounts of men being crushed to death or horrifically scolded by steam from boilers. Carnegie Steel plant was home to one of the highest rates of industrial workplace injuries with an estimated 20% of employees being injured or killed between 1907 and 1910. The worst was perhaps in 1911 at the Triangle Shirt Factory in New York City where all 147 employees died in a fire. There were no proper fire escape and exits that could have been used were locked.
