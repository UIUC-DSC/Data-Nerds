Our gorgeous mountain engulfed in a forrest fire! How can something so harrowing and destructive can in a sense be so beautiful. One certainly wonders on such a night! Please pray for our firefighters, our mountain, neighbors, for rain and for the winds to stay down! #mountaingirls #mountains #forrestfire #fireonthemountain #mendota #mendotafiretower #bigmoccasin #clinchmountain #appalachianmountains #outdoorsgirl #firefighter #fire
