Thinking about friends and everyone in Fort McMurray, stay safe. Always good to be prepared for disasters, have storage of food, water, keep your vehicle gassed up, extra fuel, grab and go bag. Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. #fortmcmurray #prepper #forrestfire #stayready #prayers #canada
