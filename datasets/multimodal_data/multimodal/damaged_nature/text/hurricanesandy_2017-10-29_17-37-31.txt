More scenes from our team down in #PuertoRico... On this Sunday, the anniversary of 2012's #HurricaneSandy in New Jersey, these images are all too powerful for those of us who can recall the disaster back then.  And yet here we are; this time in San Juan where we are lending a hand for #HurricaneMaria #PuertoRicoStrong.

@BCPONJ has dispatched detectives from the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office to Puerto Rico as part of a small contigent of our Bergen County Rapid Deployment Team.  3 BCPO Detectives and a Paramus Police Officer are serving in Puerto Rico for these next 2 weeks as task force police officers in conjunction with the New Jersey State Police and partner agencies that have banded together with the federal government to provide mutual aid in this time of need.

The Bergen County Rapid Deployment Team is on the road...more specifically on the island of Puerto Rico.  Keep up the good work down there, team.
