Wind from last night and today has knocked down a lot of branches. These are much bigger then the picture makes them look. Living surrounded by pine trees has its benefits but having branches fall and hit cars, roofs and people is for sure not one of them. #washingtonlife #fallweather #pacificnorthwest #pnwlife #upperleftusa #windstorm
