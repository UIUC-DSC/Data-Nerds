Day 10: Nature

This was taken back when hurricane Irma was just beginning to hit our area as a tropical storm. There was absolutely no damage done to any of the studio apartments across from us. No injuries either. This tree is right in front of our bedroom window. My husband was sitting in our room at the time. So when I heard it starting to crack, I couldn't yell loud enough for my husband to move from where he was. It is God alone that kept this giant branch from doing any damage. I count my blessings daily after this happened. It could have been much, much worse.
