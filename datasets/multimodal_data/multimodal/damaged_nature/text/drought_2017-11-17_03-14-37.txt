Two young men near the end of a long walk to their village in the Ethiopian Highlands.  Good roads are far and few between, and motor transport still rare between towns and mountain villages.  Ethiopians here still walk long distances to towns, and depend on their farms and animals for subsistence.  This makes them far more dependent on the variable seasonal rains, unusually heavy last year, to provide for food for their families.  After the worst drought in decades the rains came back so strong that they further threatened food security and grain was distributed by aid groups to avert potential famine. Ethiopian Highlands.
