Over year ago, the storm surge from Hurricane Matthew began to pound the shores of Les Anglais, leaving behind widespread destruction. The Ecogold Environmental Fund was proud to assist @EarthsparkIntl in their relief efforts in the aftermath of the tragic events caused by this hurricane. This week, their team is working with a local Haitian Company to take the first step towards rehabilitating their grid's distribution system. @EarthsparkIntl is an amazing organization that we truly enjoy working with and we encourage you to support them!
