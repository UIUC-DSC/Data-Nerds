Cretaceous Park! We were out on tour with top Fossilist Paddy today, teaching us how to spot the most common fossils along the the Jurassic coastline from Lyme Regis to Charnmouth. A wet and wild afternoon following 200 million years of prehistory and filling our pockets with some nice little Ammonites, Belemnites and Crynoids ðŸ˜Š Wanted to do this for AGES! Next time Iâ€™m bringing a rock hammer ðŸ’ª #lymeregismuseum #jurrasiccoast #blackven #charnmouth #lymeregis #plesiosaur #ichthyosaurs #crynoids #landslide #coast #southcoast #dorset #fossilshop #fossilhunter
