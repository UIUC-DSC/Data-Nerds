It's been a month since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. 80% of the Island is still without power and many towns are still living under these circumstances. We have to continue raising awareness and letting everyone know that this recovery will take years and the best way anyone can contribute is to stay engaged throughout it.
