Guess who shouldnâ€™t be leading a hike! ğŸ˜¬ Found ourselves on the top of Llittle Mount Doug via the Black trail, instead of big Mount Doug, which was probably a good thing in this wind, so decided to turn back when we almost blew off the mountain ğŸ’¨ğŸ’¨
Still 40 floors, enough to get the heart rate up!
