The Penang government will set up a formal Commission of Inquiry into the landslide at a construction site in Tanjung Bungah which has so far claimed the lives of three construction workers while a search and rescue mission is on for 11 others.

The landslide happened about 8.30am at Lorong Lembah Permai 3 on October 21. The construction site is for a private 50-storey affordable apartment project.
