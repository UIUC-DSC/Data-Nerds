25/30 - ‘There's Always a Playground’
_____________________________
During my 6+ years in India I was fortunate to visit Nepal a few times. A truly wonderful place and one in which I have made lifelong friends.
But my first visit will also haunt me. Arriving a couple of months after the traumatic earthquake of 25th April 2015, the memories of devastation will remain. It was as if the whole nation was dealing with PTSD. However, amongst the devastation were glimpses of the 'Nepali Spirit'. This image, of children playing with a construction bag amongst the debris of the earthquake in Thamel, Kathmandu, is a constant reminder of how no matter how difficult life can be, there are always ways to see the bright side.
Nepal. Remarkable people. Remarkable country. One that I look to return to.
