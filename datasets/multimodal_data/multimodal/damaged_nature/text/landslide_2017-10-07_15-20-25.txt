The ruins of an old church along Kilmichael Point - unlikely to make it through another few Winters.  This part of the Irish coastline is particularly susceptible to coastal erosion and is effectively crumbling into the sea. The geology comprises mainly recent sandy deposits and Irish Sea Till overlying Ordovician meta-sediments.  #kilmichaelpoint #wexford #wicklow #ireland #coast #engineeringgeology #geomorphology #erosion #sea #surf #ruins #archaeology #geology #rocks #landslide #storm
