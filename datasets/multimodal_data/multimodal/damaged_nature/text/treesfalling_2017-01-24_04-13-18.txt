So this happened yesterday and glad the tree fell that way cuz it could of fell on top of my apartment yet the tree also hit my parked car and dented the back rear end looked like a elephant rear ended me from the side though And the housing administration said they are not going to pay for the damages made to my car from the tree even though the tree is on the property of the front yard then said I'm not saying you can't file a claim with the main office ... So guess I gotta do what I gotta do I'm just happy it didn't hit my apartment and my girls and me are safe #treestomp #therewashardlyanywindthough #itwasrainingandpouring #nosundayfunday #treesfalling #lifehappensiguess ğŸŒ³ğŸ‘€ğŸ˜•ğŸš™ #pueblo #pueblodelriobelike
