52 #feet of #pinetree fell at my #Grandma' s #house. This makes me horribly sad because the yard is just so beautiful, but I'm glad that no one was hurt or any damage to my aunt, the house, or the neighbors. I counted the rings-approx 100! #minorcan #menorcan #staugustine #heritage #70year old house and my #Grandpa built it by hand after returning from #WWII #hurricanematthew #hurricaneirma #aftermath
