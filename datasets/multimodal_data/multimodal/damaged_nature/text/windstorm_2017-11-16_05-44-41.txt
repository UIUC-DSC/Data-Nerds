Yikes!!! Talk about wind gust last night.  While I was out for teaching class in the college, our yard light post ripped from the base and fell down on the ground.  Barely missed my hubby’s motorcycle trailer.  Whew!  It could have been a lot worse.  Oh, well.  Life of living in the woods.  Thanks goodness it wasn’t a big tree.
