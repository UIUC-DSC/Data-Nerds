Stupidly we decided to take the back roads to Manuel Antonio National Park. The tropical storm took out lots of the roads and eventually we ended up next to a river and the road had completely washed away. The highway guys were already busy repairing many of the sections that had been damaged which was impressive. Off for lunch in San Jose instead!
