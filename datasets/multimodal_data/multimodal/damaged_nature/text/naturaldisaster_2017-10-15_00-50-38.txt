More than a week after storm Xavier swept across Northern Germany and Poland, many of its traces of destruction are still visible. Nine people died in the two countries as winds uprooted trees, tore roofs off buildings and tipped over a crane weighing 1000 tons. Many railway lines became impassable forcing rail traffic to be shut down. Hundreds of people were stranded in cities such as Hannover, Hamburg and Berlin.
