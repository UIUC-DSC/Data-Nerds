#TBT: Hurricane Sandy damage in my neighborhood 5 years ago. Thankfully, my friends and family were safe but the recovery for some was more challenging. 
If you have the means, please consider donating to the victims of the recent weather events in this country: Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, California. Any little bit counts and there are lots of organizations doing great work on the ground.
