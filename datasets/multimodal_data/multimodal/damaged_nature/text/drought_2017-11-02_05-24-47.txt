The dams a little low. This season has been particularly tough for farmers. Rain fall has been well below average in most areas & we aren't an exception. You can help support our farmers....by purchasing their produce ðŸ¥“ðŸŒ¾. They get a fair price and you get superior food. What's not to love about that! .
