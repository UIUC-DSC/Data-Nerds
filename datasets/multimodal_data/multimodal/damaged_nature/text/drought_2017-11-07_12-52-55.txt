There used to be water here. ðŸ’§I took a little vacation from social media recently and although it was difficult initially, like trying to ignore an itch, eventually I fell into a calm space and I could concentrate on moving house and catching up with friends and just focus on what's important to me. Something I thought I was already doing. But the calm and focus I feel now makes that break worth it. I feel more creative and awake. We can't always take the time or expense to go away on holiday, but time away from social media is great for your mental health. Since baths are now a thing of the past if you live in Cape Town. It's so good to reconnect with my little community here. Missed you guys ðŸ˜Š
