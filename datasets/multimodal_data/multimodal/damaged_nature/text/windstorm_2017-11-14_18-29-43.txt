This happened last night. The tree fell directly on our power lines and we were without power for 6 hours. We notified the electric company because the tree is still sitting on the power line and itâ€™s smoking and sparking. Our neighbor tried to cut it down himself last night but the tree shocked him so we have to wait to see what happens.
