We got heavy rain for hours last night and today. 10mm since midnight, which currently is nearly 5% of our total annual amount in one day. Particularly momentous because all 15,000L of storage IS FULL! So full that one is right over the overflow line and I can afford to put a little water into the lily tank (second pic). #drought
