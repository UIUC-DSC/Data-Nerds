Devastating aftermath of Augusts mudslides in Freetown. Around 1000 people are thought to have died when tons of mud covered their homes after 3 days torrential rain and flooding. You can see in the third pic the path the mud took down the mountains, wiping out everything in its path. Camps have been set up in the area and a sombre tone fills the air in usually bustling and lively community.
