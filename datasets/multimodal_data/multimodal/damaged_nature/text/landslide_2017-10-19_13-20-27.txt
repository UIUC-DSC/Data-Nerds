This is what is left of a road (PR-186) in a small town not even an hour away from San Juan, Puerto Rico. The people here are accessible, but not from this side. Letâ€™s not forget that people still need help on this beautiful island. #PuertoRico #RioGrande #Landslide #PuertoRicoSeLevanta #HurricaneMaria
