Today the United Nations begins its Climate Change Conference in Bonn. It is also the International Day of Preventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War. @annedecarbuccia has spoken before on the current war in which we are engaged against our own planet. We must ask ourselves what sort of future we envision if we continue in our current habits. Today we send light, hope, and urgency to the countries involved in the Climate Change Conference, and we encourage each other to do all within our power to be at peace with planet.
