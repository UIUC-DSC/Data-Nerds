#actionforhaiti Today is the one year anniversary of Hurricane Matthew. The one year anniversary of our idea to start ActionForHaiti.org. So much has happened since then and yet we have so far to go. I'm looking forward to the work and I hope you will help me do it. #hurricanematthew #haiti #coteaux #donate #development #infrastructure #rebuild #haitiansforhaiti #nonprofit #organization
