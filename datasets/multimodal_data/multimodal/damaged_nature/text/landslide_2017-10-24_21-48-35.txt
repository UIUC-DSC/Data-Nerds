Happy #TBT, everyone! Here’s one from the @Science vaults: On the 19th of November, Vasquez Canyon Road in Santa Clarita, CA started to buckle. What has happened in the last week has been nothing short of miraculous. Without any sort of explanation, a 200-foot stretch of the road has buckled and risen (in some areas, up to 15 feet) so dramatically that geologists are scratching their heads as to why. There have been no recent rain storms or earthquakes that could have possibly caused such a dramatic groundswell. Geologist Dave Petley posits that it could be a “progressive landslide”, but there’s still no evidence of a trigger. Photo cred: Gantry Hill #science #geology #california #landslide #bestof
