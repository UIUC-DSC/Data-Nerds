Our country has been paralyzed by severe ice storms. Thousands are left without electricity, 40% of schools were shut, and residents were advised not to drink tap water. I am so grateful everythink is OK in our home. Sending prayers to all affected families all around the Europe and other world as well ðŸ’«ðŸ˜˜ #slovenia #icestorm #europe #weather #tiueurope #tiuslovenia #naturaldamage #ice #snow
