Back home time for some cleaning.. @ surf popoyo lessons property... We are still without power after 8 days.  We have been helping out the community the best we can. People are still without food, clothing, medications, beds and flashlights/candles. If you can in anyway please support our community by donating or sharing our gofundme link. No amount is to small.. https://www.gofundme.com/save-surf-popoyo-lessonsguasacate
