#Nate has severely affected this area and its people!! Just because the storm has passed doesn't mean the problem is solved... People are hurt and missing, thousands are without homes, belongings, livelihoods and other losses. I always loved living on this river that brought me peace, and in one night it flooded the whole town and turned the riverbank, including our backyard, into a landslide. My site is still without clean running water and safe roads, and there is a lot of rebuilding to do everywhere.

Also all the extreme weather lately isn't out of nowhere. I think this is a sliver of what happens when we don't treat our planet right. Our oceans are warming and absorbing a lot of the impact, and not caring is only going to hurt us.  #tropicalstorm #landslide #hurricane #costarica #aguacero #hurricanenate #climatechange #globalwarming #rionaranjo #londres #puntarenas
