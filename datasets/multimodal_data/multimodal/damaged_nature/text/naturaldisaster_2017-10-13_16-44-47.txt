Part 3: This area in Italy did burn in 2016. One can still see dead trees and more signs of the wildfire, but there are also a lot of new plants. This wildfire was not effecting any humans so it did not turn into a hazard or a catastrophe. #wildfire #Waldbrand #naturaldisaster #naturkatastrophe #naturalcatastrophe  #hazard
