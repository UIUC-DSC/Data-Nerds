I took these photos a year ago today during #HurricaneMatthew. The flooding was very bad in spots. The streets you see here are from Rocky Mount as the Tar River flooded the town. The parking lot with the vans submerged is near Downtown Raleigh. #ncwx #WRAL #Hurricane #Flooding #Raleigh #NC #NorthCarolina #RockyMount #Weather
