We knew the damage to Wesumkee was bad, but seeing the destruction of the buildings and the camp covered in sand is very sobering. We are Girl Scouts, we are strong and we will rebuild. 
Please continue to donate to our #givemiamiday page (link in our bio) to help us rebuild. But hurry, because thereâ€™s only a few hours left!
