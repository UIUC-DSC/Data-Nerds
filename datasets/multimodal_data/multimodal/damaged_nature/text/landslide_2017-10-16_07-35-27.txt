Crazy cool hike today to Waimano Falls. It was pretty muddy even before the afternoon rain, in some spots it was like only the tree roots were holding the ground in place. A few spots were pretty terrifying but that's what I want in my life. The feeling after finishing a task that could have killed you is just the most incredible feeling in the world. Get out of your comfort zone. #blessed #waimanofalls #waimanotrail #waimano #hawaiihikes #oahuhikes #oahuhiking #oahuhiker #oahu #waterfalls #96792 #808 #landslide
