Hurricane Irma damaged so many docks and structures down in South Georgia. It affected our ability to conduct research at our altered estuary near Noyes Cut and Umbrella Creek. We took two months off because all of our access docks were severely damaged. Here is one that was twisted by the strong winds and surge. #hurricane #hurricaneirma #irma #stormdamage #georgia #coast #saltlife
