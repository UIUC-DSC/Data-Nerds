Each day this week, we are sharing comparisons between places just after Hurricane Matthew and now a year later. Seeing the Mission compound wreckage, we continually praise God for keeping our staff safe during the disaster and for providing to rebuild! #haitibiblemission #thenandnow #hurricanematthew #compound #oneyearlater
