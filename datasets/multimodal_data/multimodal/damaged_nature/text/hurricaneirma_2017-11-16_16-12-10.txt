As we enter #Day57 since #HurricaneMaria and #Day72 since #HurricaneIrma we need to support the #PuertoRicans on the island who are doing what needs to get done. 
Now that some are accessing social media and  posting their efforts letâ€™s repost, share and  supporting them in any way we can! For example, @rescateplayasborinquen is at the parks and beaches and fixing the damage done by Hurricanes Irma + Maria.

They established an Ecological Center using the abandoned former Navy Buildings near the ruins of the Spanish Lighthouse in #PuntaBorinquen #Aguadilla. Â #PuntaBorinquenEcoCenter#PuertoRicoParks #PuertoRicoBeaches #PuertoRico â€¢
