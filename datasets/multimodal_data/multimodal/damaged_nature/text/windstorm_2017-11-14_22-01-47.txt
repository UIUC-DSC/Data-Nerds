A giant eucalyptus tree brought down by a powerful wind and dust storm that swept through Jerusalem in 2010. The tree landed on two parked cars and knocked down electrical wires (you can see the raw wires on the lower right of the photo). Eucalyptus trees are native to Australia and were first imported into Israel in the 1880s. The eucalyptus tree played a major role in the Jewish return to the Land of Israel. During our absence of nearly 2000 years, Israel was turned into a vast desert interrupted by pockets of malarial swamp. The eucalyptus trees were planted all over the country to absorb the standing swamp water where the malarial mosquitoes swarmed. This was such an important part of the Jewish return that there are Israeli folk songs about planting the eucalyptus orchards. The local Arabs refer to the eucalyptus as sejrat el-yahud "the tree of the Jews". Today the mosquitoes that cause Malaria are extinct in Israel. Location: Baka, Jerusalem.
