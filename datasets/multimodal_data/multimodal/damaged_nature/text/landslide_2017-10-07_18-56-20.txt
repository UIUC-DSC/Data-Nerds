The tiny #Swiss hamlet of #Bondo knew it was endangered by rockslides, and built a special retention basin. But when 3 million cubic meters of mountain suddenly crashed down onto a glacier and then hurtled down the valley into town, the basin quickly overflowed. The region's only road into nearby #Italy was blocked, and after further substantial rockslides was under up to 3 meters of rubble. Now the town is digging out of what in some places looks like about 5 or 6 stories of a concrete-like mixture of water, rock dust, #rocks and huge #boulders.  #bergell #bergsturz #forzabregaglia #maira #sottoponte #cleanup #landslide #promontogno #bregaglia #bagger #bach #stream #bergell #aufräumen #switzerland #nature #mothernature #bigmachines
