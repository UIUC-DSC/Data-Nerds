An short animation I made from my collaboration project with my friend @rks.design. He made this amazing model and I did all the texturing, shading, lighting, rendering, baking and animating. It was a pleasure working together, go check him out ^^
Anyway this animation really took long to make. The models's design is from cgCookie. The music is from incompetech.com .
