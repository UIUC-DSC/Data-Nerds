Early morning sweat session ✔  Breakfast ready to roll ❌ 
Oat’s about time you gave these Quaker Protein sachets a whizz, packing in a whopping 8.1g of protein per pouch (protein contributes to the growth and maintenance of muscle mass) making them the perfect post workout power kick to take on the day ahead 💪🏼💪🏼. Don’t just take our word for it, you really oat to just give them a go and thankfully for you we got just the recipe to do so (link in our story)! TTH x #twicethehealth👯
