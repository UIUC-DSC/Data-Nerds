I have bought other massagers that come with the massaging rolling balls inside, but none of them quite did the trick to what I was looking for. Some had too many and didn’t do the right job. 
I ordered the Shiatsu massage cushion with a pillow from Gideon because the features and the right amount of rolling balls, (2) it has the option of doing your full back, lower back and upper back with or with out heat. You can choose the level of vibration from low, medium and hard and it also has a timer on the remote so if you doze off during your massage the massager will automatically turn off. 
I like this one better than the rest because it doesn’t leave me feeling sore the next day if I indulge in an hour long massage, it has the right amount of vibration with the 2 balls and doesn’t over due it on your body. You can see the massager here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B075CD1W17?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_pd
