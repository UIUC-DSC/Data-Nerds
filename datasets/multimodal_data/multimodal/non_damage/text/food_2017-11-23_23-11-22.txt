This is my plate half full. Still there's a lot delicious food left. Feeling the most of every flavor. How every component of this plate comes from nature and is made with love, with good intentions. The hands that made it are full of energy and that's what I feel, thats the energy that I wanna get into me, into my system, into my surroundings. I'm eating love, not death. ðŸŒž
That feeling of getting refuel of good energy is beautiful. After all, that's what food is about.
