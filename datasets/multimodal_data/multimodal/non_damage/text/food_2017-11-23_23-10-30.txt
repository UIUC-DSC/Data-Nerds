Vegetarian chilli, “chickun” burger and stir fried kale and sugar snaps
.
I just cooked one of my seitan “chickun” burgers straight from the freezer, heated up some chili I made yesterday (recipe to follow another time!) and stir fried some kale and sugar snaps with olive oil and a little crushed garlic and salt (I splashed on a little @lkkeurope soy sauce right at the end too).
.
Who else thinks the most satisfying meals are often the simplest ones?
.
Took so little effort and it was so yummy!
