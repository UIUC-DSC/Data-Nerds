I ordered this Rimable longboard from Amazon.  It's 41" long.  I posted a picture of it next to my skateboard so you can see the height difference. The deck is half inch thick and it's made with Maple / bamboo hybrid laminate.  It's a nice sturdy board with strong grip tape and a beautiful Polynesian design.  I haven't messed around much with this board because of the holidays just been busy, but I did notice that the trucks are really tight. It's hard to turn.  It might just need broken in. If not I'll just have to get some new trucks because I like to board. My ten-year-old had fun riding it. He says it's easier to ride than a skateboard. We ordered using Amazon Prime and the board arrived and two days.  It was in perfect condition no scratches on the design or anything.  It's a little chilly here in Ohio right now.  I do look forward to riding this board more when  the weather gets nicer. #iwasinvited #invitedbyagleam #ad #rimable #longboard  https://smile.amazon.com/Rimable-Bamboo-Through-Longboard-Polynesian/dp/B019F01O96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8
