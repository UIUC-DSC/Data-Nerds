WinterFest at @cagreatamerica in Santa Clara, California opens tonight! This is a next level theme park holiday celebration for sure. Breathtaking decorations, ice skating, live shows & performance, and of course characters. My kids loved meeting the gingerbread man, Holly the elf and Miss Candy Cane. Next up for us- Peanuts meet and greets ! WinterFest is open on weekends in the evenings and admission is very reasonable - purchase online in advance to save even more. #ad #tmom #gawinterfest #winterfest #cagreatamerica #greatamerica #familytravel #santaclara #kidifornia #visitcalifornia
