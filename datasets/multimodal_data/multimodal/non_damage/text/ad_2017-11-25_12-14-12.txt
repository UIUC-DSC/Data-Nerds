One the of the best experiences EVER! Thank you @iflygoldcoast #ad for an unforgettable experience. The kids were naturals and Adrian has never wanted to do sky diving with me but was more than happy to do it indoors ðŸ˜‰

Whatâ€™s even more amazing is anyone can do this. On Sunday 3rd December in celebration of the International Day Of People With Disabilities @iflyoz will be sending 100 people living with disability into the air!!! Proving nothing can keep them on the ground #GiftofFlight

Remember we can ALL #BeASuperhero ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘­ðŸ‘¬who has ever been sky diving or wants to?
