I bathe both of our dogs and our cat on a regular basis. My husband has allergies and bathing our fur babies helps him immensely. Due to the amount of bathing they get I have struggled with finding a pet shampoo that does not dry out their skin especially in the winter months.
This pet shampoo does not produce a ton of lather however still cleans their fur really nicely. The fact that there is not a lot of lather helps the rinsing process. For reference, I used twice as much shampoo on Daffy then I did on Dagan (her hair is more wirey and thick). So if you want a more sudsy lather you will need to use a much larger amount. They have all had 2 baths using this shampoo so far. It has really helped cut down on the dander and all of their coats are incredibly soft. 
The shampoo has a very light pleasant scent. I like the combination used â€“ the oatmeal, shea butter and aloe vera keeps their skin and coats moisturized. Another great thing about this shampoo is that it is formulated to not sting in the event it gets near your pets eyes.
