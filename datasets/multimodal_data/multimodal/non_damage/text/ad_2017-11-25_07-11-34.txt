Marketing #nike hack 1/3!!! HAVE PURPOSEFUL MESSAGING ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¼ The Air Jordans were technically advanced basketball shoes, but their true value to most customers was that they looked cool...really cool. This created a buzz among potential customers. In "Sole Man," former NBA All-Star, Chris Webber recants the first time he saw someone wearing Air Jordans, saying, "It was recess 1986. I was 13 years old. This kid who used to just be fresher than everybody else...had on these red and black Jordans. I just remember all us going 'oh,' just sitting looking at his Jordans." When the value of your product is easy to identify, it creates purposeful word-of-mouth marketing. For example, people may ask, "May I send you the money I owe you through Venmo?" Pay special attention to the emotions that your product evokes and how it helps your customers express themselves. These succinct, powerful messages raise awareness for your product and deliver customers to your sales funnel.

Not only has Nike replicated this process with other athletes through the years so have its competitors, like Adidas and Under Armour. Companies like Beats By Dre have also utilized these principles. Regardless of your budget, these strategies can help market your product and company to thousands if not millions of people.
