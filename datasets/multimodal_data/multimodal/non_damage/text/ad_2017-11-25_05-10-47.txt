I'm in love with the Cubo Aqua Audio waterproof speaker. As a busy mom, privacy is almost non existent so the shower is really my only time to myself and I love listening to music. With Cubo I don't have to worry about my kids pushing buttons or running off with it like they do when I play music on my phone. I was worried about clarity when water hit it but audio is crystal clear. I also love that it's Bluetooth wireless so it's Siri compatible and you can connect up to 50 ft away- any phone and tablet ! With the built in microphone you can answer calls and even though I worried about battery life, you get about 10 hours of listening time before it needs to be charged again which is a wonderful. I love that it's portable, we've taken it to hotels, public pools, friends houses and never an issue with the suction cup not holding-- I'd imagine it'd be great on a boat as well. I'm planning to get another for a Christmas gift!
