This immersion cooker is awesome! It is very sleek and modern looking composed of stainless steel. It has a nice lcd display that shows what temp the water is currently, the temp you have it set for and how much time the dish has left to cook. 
This was really easy to set up and use for the first time. It includes an adjustable mount, so it can easily be fastened to any to any pot or  container. You don't use the stove, you just need an outlet to use it.

The first thing I made with this was boiled eggs for egg salad. After setting everything it up, it took about thirty minutes for it to heat to 76 degrees Celsius. Once it got to the temperature it needed to be, it took one hour for them to cook. The eggs turned out really well; they were fully cooked and tasted great. I'm not sure if I would ever use it to make eggs again since it takes an hour and a half to make them, but I really enjoyed using the product and I am excited to try it with other things!
