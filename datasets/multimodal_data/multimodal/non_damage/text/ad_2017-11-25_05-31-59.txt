Sweater weather is officially upon us and just in time for the holiday season. While shopping for holiday gifts, head over to @thredUP for great secondhand (sometimes New-with-Tags) items of designer brands at discounted prices. Ya know, the super cute #thriftythings that make great gifts. For example, I snagged this cashmere (yes cashmere!) sweater and scarf along with a cute Ralph Lauren brown tote for over 50% off retail. Clearly I’m doing a little self gifting first before I do my holiday shopping (guilty!). Be sure to think #secondhandfirst this Black Friday/Cyber Monday.  #ad
