Contrary to popular belief, this #fitchick can and does cook. One of the most common questions that I get when I tell people that I love to cook and entertain people in my home is, “do you make healthier versions of your favorite recipes?” And my answer is always a resounding “hell naw.” I don’t think of myself as having a “diet” from day to day, but rather a lifestyle that I️ live. I️ eat clean 85% of the time, and can count on one hand the days of the year that I️ don’t. As a result, I fully enjoy the holidays without the slightest regard to counting calories, gluten, carbs, etc. etc.

However, I do have some tips for keeping your abs post-thanksgiving and not going overboard.
•
1. Drink at least one (maybe two) full glasses of water before you start eating.
2. Fill up on protein first. Pile all the turkey, ham, duck, etc. and eat that to help you feel fuller, quicker.
2. Make sure at least two of the items on your plate are green vegetables. Greens, salad, green beans-just make sure you’re getting your fibrous veggies
3. Plan your workout around what you’re eating. You need to put all those extra calories to work-so plan a heavy back or leg day following Thanksgiving.
4. Enjoy the day to the max, but wake up tomorrow morning at get back on track with your regular diet. One bad day of eating won’t kill your physique, but an entire weekend of binge eating absolutely will. •
