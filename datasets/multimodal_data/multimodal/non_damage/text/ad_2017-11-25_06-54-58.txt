So sometimes I have too much stuff and I’m trying to minimize the 💩 in my life. So I have started selling a lot of my old clothes that no longer fit me on eBay and  my lovely friend (you know who you are) gifted me with a dress form and it made the clothes look so much better!  eBay people have  been purchasing them which is awesome, because I’m loving being rid of stuff and making money. But your hot mess mom girl right here is so lazy I just end up taking pictures with the clothes all wrinkly. 🤦🏻‍♀️🙈🤷🏻‍♀️So I decided to invest in a clothing steamer. I purchased this Gideon handheld steam cleaner. So I am super excited about this clothing steamer so my clothes look great and better, selling faster , and I make more money, win win. I also bought this clothing steamer for my husbands lovely T-shirts because this hot mess mom has absolutely zero time to iron a T-shirt. The only thing husband wears it doesn’t look all scrubby with wrinkles so this is my solution. Look how great it works!
