So I’ve finally found the perfect seat cushion massager for my car, I was originally going to give it my honey, that is, until I used it first. Even my 6 year old asked if he could have it for his spot in the car. You know you’ve found a good one when everyone is asking to have it. 
The material is very soft and light and isn’t stiff or hard to sit up and adjust against. The features on this one are just amazing. It’s got 5 different modes to choose from ranging from  pulsate to kneading all at the intensity level of you choice. It also has the heat option so now in the winter I can keep my bum warm while getting a light massage. The two favorite spots on the one for me is the lower back and hips, it helps me so much. Car pickup line just became one of my favorite times of day, want to see more check it out here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B018WMPQJ2?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_pd
