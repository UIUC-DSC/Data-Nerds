This is a 6 Motor Massage Cushion with Heat. This massager works best for me in the car. It has changeable adapters that can be used in the house or it can be plugged into the cigarette port in the car. This massager vibrates in different motions. There are 8 modes it can be switched to which offer a variety of vibrations. I personally prefer mode 6. They do make a slight sound as it is vibrating but nothing too annoying. Just a normal vibrating sound. As I mentioned in the beginning this massager works best for me in the car because is light weight and super soft I barely know it’s there. And I can switch it on wherever I’d like. But what I use most is the heat option. There is an option to use heat and the heat also works without having to use the vibration part of the massage seat. So on these cold mornings we have had these past few days I have been turning this heated seat on when I warm up my car in the morning for some extra warmth. The material feels really good. It does wrinkle up a bit once u use it a while but that is hardly noticeable as you can see from my picture. And it does not affect the enjoyment this massager gives.
