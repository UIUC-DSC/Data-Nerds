The Gideon Long Arm Rechargeable Cordless Vibrating Percussion Massager is amazing. This handheld massager has a rechargeable battery so you can use it just about any where and you don't have to worry about being confined to an area that has a wall outlet to plug it in. This massager can run for one and half hours off of a charge, you could take this with you on the go. It comes with a stand that holds it and the attachments, there are three attachments one with one nodule, another with three nodules and a third with four nodules. I love that it  has a long handle for hard to reach places on your back. the massager is great for sore achy muscles and helps relieve pain and increases blood circulation.  #ad #iwasinvited
