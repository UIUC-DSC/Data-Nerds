I took the girls to see Coco & #OlafsFrozenAdventure en Espa√±ol and it was an emotional feast. We continued our yearly tradition to see the Tour of Lights and the Vitruvian Park Christmas Lights. I needed that. So much. So grateful for this wonderful #Buick and the memories we are making in it. #FBLights #PixarCoco #PixarCocoEvent #ad
