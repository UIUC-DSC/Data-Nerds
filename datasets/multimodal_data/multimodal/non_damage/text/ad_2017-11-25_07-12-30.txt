So my dogs love these jack & pup dog treats and I am loving that my dogs are a lot more quieter and calm so I bought some more. The Jack and pup bully sticks are the perfect solution to helping my dogs calm down especially with this holiday recently they were acting crazy when people come over. Iâ€™m so sick of their dog butts running and jumping all over my friends and family. So I just give them one of these bully sticks kick them outside and when they finish they can come back in calm and ready to see everyone. It also helps my puppy from stopping and eating my childrenâ€™s toys sheâ€™s making my son very upset by chewing on all of his favorite things ðŸ™„ So if you have a hyper active sure for a puppy in your home need to get some of these.
