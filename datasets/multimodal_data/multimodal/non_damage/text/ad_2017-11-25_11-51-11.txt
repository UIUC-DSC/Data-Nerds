Gideon Wireless handheld back massager is so nice because it’s wireless. So a lot of times when you want to use a handheld  electronic massager the cords to plug in are generally very short. So when I want to use one or make my husband use it on me I cannot lay down in my bed. So how am I supposed to get a relaxing massage I can’t even relax. So I specifically went looking for a cordless handheld massager and I found this.  it comes with three different types of pressure point heads. my favorite is just the one massager Head node. It has its own docking base that holds the attachments and it comes precharged and ready to go. So in love with this handheld cordless back massager.
