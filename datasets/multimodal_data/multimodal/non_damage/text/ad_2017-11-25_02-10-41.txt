The holiday entertaining officially starts i our household this weekend. One of my signature drinks for this season is this refreshing @Frangelico Mojito ( #spon ). I would have never thought to pair hazelnut liqueur with rum and lime, but my husband and I were hooked after the first sip. If you’re looking for an inspired twist on a classic cocktail, give this a try. 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
Mix together 1.75 parts Frangelico Liqueur, 1/2 part J.Wray Jamaican Rum, a few mint leaves, and 1/2 part of lime juice. Shake all the ingredients, pour over ice and garnish with fresh mint.
