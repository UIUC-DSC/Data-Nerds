Honey was pretty jealous of my recent purchase of my massaging chair that I got from Gideon for my car and that he didn’t get one, thank goodness Amazon Prime has 2 day shipping, I ended up get him one a bit different than mine. This one is a six motor massage cushion, and I of course got him one that has a heat feature. It’s his favorite of any massager. 
It has different modes to choose from, and has a timer option as well so it doesn’t put you to sleep while driving to work. It’s a soft material that you sink into and it’s strong enough of a massager and vibration to really work my guy, he’s a big dude and sometimes it take a lot to really work his back. My honey is very pleased with this massager, and he told me that his 45 minutes work commute easier and possibly enjoyable. My honey recommends this so if you need one for your honey this would be an awesome Christmas present. You can get it here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0753VB2FR?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_pd
