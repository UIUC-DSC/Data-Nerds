💎Olaplex no. As a Cutting Lotion💎

I did a @olaplex treatment on this beauties big-chop day! I used no.2 as a stand alone treatment today. And before I rinsed her out, I used it as a cutting lotion! If you haven’t used it for cutting, you haven’t LIVED! The hair feels soft and silky, shiny like whoa!, and helps bring together those bonds that need some TLC! Absolutely incredible! #olaplexalldayeveryday .
