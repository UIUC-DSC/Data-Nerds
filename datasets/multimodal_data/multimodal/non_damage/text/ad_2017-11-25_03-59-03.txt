My friend is having a baby shower for her daughter and I was trying to pick out some good gifts to get they she could get great use from. I selected this 
La Luna Smart Interactive Baby Soother. It makes a shushing sound and is activated when the baby cries for about ten seconds. The sound is supposed to mimic the sounds they hear in the womb , so would be an ideal gift for a newborn. You can also record your own voice or sound to use. Would be great for in the middle of the night when the baby wakes up and your voice comes and and they go back to sleep. I like this products size it will be great to take anywhere you need to use it. I also like the fact that it is usb chargeable no need to worry about batteries.
