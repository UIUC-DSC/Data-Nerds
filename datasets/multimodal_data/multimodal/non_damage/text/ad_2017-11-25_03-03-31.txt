This Gideon Shiatsu Deep Kneading Massage Pillow with Eight Rollers and Heat / Massage, Relax, Sooth and Relieve Neck, Shoulder and Back Pain is a smaller version of Gideon’s larger neck massager. 
But just because it’s smaller, doesn’t mean it doesn’t work just as well.  It’s the perfect size for attaching to your car seat, or setting behind your head in your favorite chair.  I also like using it on my lower back - it gets those spots that others miss. 
The heated shiatsu action is so soothing.  It’s a great deep tissue massage that you can position wherever you need it.  Each set of rollers has 2 large and two small rollers that rotate and get all those sore spots.
