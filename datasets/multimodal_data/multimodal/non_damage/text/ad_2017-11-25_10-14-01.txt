This Christmas stocking from Babyblooms is handmade in the UK, and the luxurious fabric and superb craftsmanship make this a wonderful gift for baby’s first Christmas. The lovely addition of baby’s name (up to 10 letters), beautifully embroidered in matching thread creates a gift to be treasured for years to come. Can be bought as a set with Bertie Bear (check other images in set) as well as other options. 🎅💙🦁
The Bashful Lion featured in my photo can be bought separately. ⏩⏩⏩ Read more on The Purple Pumpkin Blog 💜🎃 Link to my blog in bio or click: http://bit.ly/2zWwjth ⏪⏪⏪
