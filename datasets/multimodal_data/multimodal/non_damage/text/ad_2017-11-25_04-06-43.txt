One of the things I realized last month is that I need to get my life a bit more organized. I have struggled forever with choosing between using an electronic organizer vs. a handwritten one. I have finally decided to use my phone for appointments and a hand written one for all of my blogging and Instagram scheduling. I recently found this adorable 2018 planner from @heartofthefarmplanner  and I am so excited to try it! I love the buffalo check hard cover and that when it is open it lays perfectly flat. Plus I can use the month at a glance and weekly pages to stay organized! I am also ordering her menu organizer for all of the pages I have printed from the internet. (Right now I have a one inch stack of loose pages stuffed in my cookbook cabinet! I cannot wait to put them in plastic sleeves in a binder!)
