Living in less than 300 square feet with my husband and toddler is interesting enough, but when you add an 80lb dog to the mix things get smelly fast!  I started using this shampoo on my dog and noticed a difference immediately!  It smells great and leaves him smelling fresh and clean.  The tea tree and aloe has really helped his coat and he is not scratching all of the time like he normally does.  He gets bathed frequently but this shampoo allows me to wait a little longer between baths before I start to smell him again. Very impressed! This is a huge bottle!  Such a great value for the price!
