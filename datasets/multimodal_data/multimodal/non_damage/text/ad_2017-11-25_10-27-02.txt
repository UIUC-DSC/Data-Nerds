#ad DELI SANDWICH 🥪 I’ve been really getting into a good sandwich lately, especially last week when I was whizzing around Dublin picking up things around the city ready for HBCxMeet. Sandwiches are so good when you’re on the go and need something quick. This one I made with Carroll’s New York Deli ham @carrollsoftullamore and I combined it with Asian flavours. Crunchy veg and a drizzle of hoisin sauce go really well with the ham, all sandwiched in a wholemeal bun. All the best bits from a stir-fry but grab-and-go style! 😆 .
