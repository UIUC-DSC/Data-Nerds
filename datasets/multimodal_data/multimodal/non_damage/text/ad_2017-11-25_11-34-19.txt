Out of all the massagers that I have, this one from Gideon is by far my favorite. This one targets the knots on my upper back (which I always have a problem with) and it feels so damn good! It does feel like a massage therapist is doing it on me. Even though it doesnâ€™t have a control on how much pressure/intensity, I can simply control it by how hard I press my back against it. The heat makes it even better for me to relax. It does come with a wall plug and a car charger but I am keeping mine at home so I can use it after a long day at work. #ad #IWasInvited #gideon
