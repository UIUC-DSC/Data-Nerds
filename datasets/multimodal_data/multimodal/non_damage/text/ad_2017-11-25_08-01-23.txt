‚ú®PUT YOUR HAND UP & GO ORANGE TO END VIOLENCE IN VICTORIA ‚ú®I've put my hand up‚úãÔ∏èto #GoOrange to support a Victoria #FreeFromViolence. Now you to can #PutYourHandUp to end violence against women and children and GoOrange on Facebook! Victoria Against Violence @WomenVictoria is a 16 day community campaign calling upon local communities to take action to help prevent family violence and make Victoria a safer and more equal place for EVERYONE. The color ORANGE symbolizes a safer future for all and represents hope and a future free of violence against women, families and girls. To get in the spirit of this great campaign I have painted my right hand orange while making myself a Turmeric face mask and a plate of fresh oranges üçä ready for a relaxing eveningüõÅ #putyourhandup #goorange #freefromviolence #ad
