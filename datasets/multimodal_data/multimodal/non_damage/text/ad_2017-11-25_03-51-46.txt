This massage cushion is great! It has 10 vibrating points that work your shoulders, back, hips and thighs. It has five different modes, including pulsating, tapping, rolling, kneading and auto. They range from a gentle to deep kneading massage. You can also control the intensity with the remote and add heat to your massage to help relax your muscles.

This massager comes with a DC and AC adapter, so it can be used in the car's cigarette  lighter or in any regular outlet. It is really light and comes in a nice case with a handle, making it really easy to transport and travel with. If your car takes awhile to warm up this would be great to use in the car to keep you from freezing while waiting for your car to heat up.
