What a perfect massager for my office. I'm never comfortable temperature wise ehile at work so im Either freezing or burning up. This vibrating Gideon massager helps with that because  it heats up and cools down! The cushion fits great in my office chair and isnt bulky or uncomfortable. During the holidays I'm at work up to 14 hours and my lower back starts hurting. This massager not only helps relieve my back pain but helps keep me warm during these cold days. Operation is simple, quality is excellent, comfort is amazing and price is perfect. This is a win!
