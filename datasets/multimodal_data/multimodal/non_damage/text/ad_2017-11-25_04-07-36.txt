These shin bones are huge! I'm not to sure what they taste like or taste good beause I didn't taste them. But my dogs seemed to love them. You get 3 very large bones in this pack. I like these better than raw hide because these won't splinter. I also feel that these are healthier for the dogs. These are from a grass feed animal(not sure what animal).These are all natural so I don't have to worry about giving them to my allergy prone dog. These will last your dog quite a while. My 3 dogs are big chewers. As I write this they are going on day 3 of chewing on them. So if your looking for a tasty long lasting treat then go and grap these.#ad #iwasinvited #jackandpup #shinbone#dogtreats #dogs#bones
