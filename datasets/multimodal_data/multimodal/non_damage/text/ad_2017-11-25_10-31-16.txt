One month to go. 
So. I've set myself a slightly crazy challenge. To buy all of my Christmas gifts from small and local businesses ðŸ™ˆ this is clearly the talk of a mad woman, but luckily I've been inspired by the #EtsyMadeLocalUK campaign. @etsyuk are bringing their sellers offline and into the community with local markets celebrating unique and handmade gifts like these. 
You can find your local market by visiting www.etsy.com/local. I've blogged about why I've myself this challenge and what Etsy have to offer. Link is in my profile. Please have a read and let me know if you plan to attend a market local to you ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
