By far the  Gideon Luxury Six-Program Fully Customizable Back and Neck Massaging Cushion with Heat / Shiatsu Deep Kneading, Rolling and Vibrating has been the best massager I have ever used.  The biggest draw for me is the neck massager.  That was never included in the designs of massagers and cushions I have previously tried.  The cushion itself is very strong and durable.  It has a very high back that will work well for a tall person.  That also created what I saw as a potential issue.  As I am quite short at 5'3" tall when sitting on the cushion the neck balls was directly under the bottom of my head and top of the neck.  Luckily there is the ability to adjust the nodes in the neck to go up and down.  I also tried sitting on a pillow to boost me up a bit.  The back massager is Shiatsu and/or rolling style.  The bottom cushion allows for vibration.  Heat can be added to both the back and neck.  The kneading on my neck and back were super deep and strong.  It kind of hurt in the beginning but I got used to it after a little while.  All in all, it's got all I look for in a massaging cushion and more.
