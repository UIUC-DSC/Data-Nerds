I really enjoy painting, however finding a good quality brush without spending a fortune can be difficult. This set of 6 brushes comes nicely packaged. I am going to use the package for storing after each use to keep the brushes like new. The set includes assorted shapes (round, flat and filbert – 2 of each) so you can create a wide variety of strokes and textures. The long wood brush handle feels good in my hand, and is easy to grip. After multiple uses I haven’t had any issues with the bristles shedding.
The variety offered makes it a great starter brush set. They work well with acrylics, and would also be good for watercolors, face painting, etc. See the link below for additional details and reviews.
