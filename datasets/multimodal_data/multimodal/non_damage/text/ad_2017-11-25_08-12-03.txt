I love this Bluetooth speaker. It's super easy to set up and use. It has really good sound quality and a decent sound range. The charge could be better, but it's not bad. It lasts up to ten hours depending on the volume you use it at. However, it doesn't take long at all for it to be recharged if you are using a turbo charger. They also provide the charging cable, so you don't have to worry about getting an extra cable or using the one you use for your phone for this one.

This speaker is water resistant, so it is great to use in the shower and by the pool. I've used it a couple times now and it's still working despite being exposed to water. I think this would be a great item to pack on vacations and camping trips.
