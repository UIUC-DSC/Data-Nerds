ðŸ™ŒEBAY RESPONDINGðŸ™Œ

Would you look at that! After making a formal complaint and reaching out to others in the community, eBay listened and took action! This is huge! Literally will put tens of thousands back into the pockets of sellers by not keeping ad fees!

I donâ€™t want to be too surprised but when I was speaking with twitter eBay, and staff at their call centers, it didnâ€™t appear to be something resolved so quickly- just a few weeks later we have results! I wasnâ€™t the only person to reach out and I want to thank anyone else who took the time to do so.

This shows is a couple things- eBay cares, and they are interested in improving their platform & services to work for US. I mean, we work really hard for them too ðŸ˜† #reciprocity -
