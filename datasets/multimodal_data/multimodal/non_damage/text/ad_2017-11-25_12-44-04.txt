When you have a wriggle worm of a 20 month old, taking their temperature can be a bit of a struggle when using the more traditional methods....thank goodness for modern technology! Sailor has been feeling a little under the weather for the past week or so, and I'm always keen to keep an eye on his temperature as he tends to get hot very quickly when he's poorly. We've been using the @NokiaHealth Thermo lately which works without contact by simply being scanned across the forehead...this is ideal with 3 little ones around as its far more hygienic and means I don't have to worry about changing hygiene caps each time we use it. It also makes it much easier to keep track of readings as they're automatically sent to the Nokia Health Mate app and recorded...another blessing when you have 3 little ones as it can be quite tricky to remember who had what temperature when they're all poorly at once! (Which inevitably they always are!) We've tried a lot of different thermometers over the years but this is by far the most helpful and most simple to use too.
