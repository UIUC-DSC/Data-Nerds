I have failed countless times in many things. I failed at being a varsity player. I failed at being a theatre performer. I failed my chemistry class, a math quiz bee, and my first press conference. I failed my first job interview and my first work assignment. Several times, I have also failed people, unable to meet their expectations, including my parents. But I’m glad I failed. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have learned the importance of taking risks and tackling challenges in order to grow in confidence. I wouldn’t have discovered more about myself, my strengths and weaknesses, my skills and potentials. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have learned to appreciate every step I take towards my aspirations. The truth is failing doesn’t make you a failure. So keep going #LikeAGirll ! #always @always_brand #ad
