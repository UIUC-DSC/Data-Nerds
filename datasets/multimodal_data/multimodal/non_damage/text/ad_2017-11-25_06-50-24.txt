This massager is much like the last one I reviewed. It massages with vibrations. The difference between this one and the last is it has many more options on the remote. As you can see from my pictures, it can be set in one of 5 different modes and one, two, three or all four different listed areas of the body. I prefer pulsating hips.  You can also choose “auto” which will go through all different modes. It is the same soft material as in my last review. There is a nice little pocket on the side to store the remote so it will not be left dangling. There are changeable adapters which allow it to be used in the house or car. I’ve tried it in both as well as laying on it in the bed which I like best. This makes for a good gift to give to a coworker or just to have around. And lastly I can’t forget to mention the heat option. That’s always a great feeling to have that heat on your back. This massager folds away for easy storage.
