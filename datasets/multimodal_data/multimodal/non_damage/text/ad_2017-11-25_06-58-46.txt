What is something you try to find time for everyday? Breakfast? Books? For me it is a cup of tea or coffee slowly sipped in peace. It can be in the morning or evening but I want to inhale the warmth, savour each gulp and drink it at a leisurely pace.

And hey! @danielwellington is having a Black Friday sale. You got time for that? (Is that a bad pun?üòù). You will get a complimentary strap with the purchase of any DW watch. That means two watches at the price of one because the straps are super easy to change. And hey, hey! The folks at DW have sent me a discount code ‚ÄòTHEBOOKSATCHEL‚Äô to share with you guys. The code will fetch you 15% off on your purchase. Go crazy! Happy shopping.
