Have you guys been holiday shopping? If not for gifts, let's talk outfitting! I've got the best holiday outfits for her on the blog, but for kids, have you checked out @carters? They seriously have the cutest outfits from slim fitting pants for boys (this is new-ish), tons of plaid for both girls and boys, and baby tulle skirts (um hi yes please). We #lovecarters from birth for sure but I love dressing the babes as they are getting older too! #ad | my outfit --> Follow me in the LIKEtoKNOW.it app to shop this look http://liketk.it/2tAOa #liketkit @liketoknow.it #mommyandme #toddlerstyle #kidstyle #motherhood
