We've just had a quick warmup before our lesson and quickly catching some vitamin D and a water break before #ANZTennisHotShots begins. 
This week the two have learnt how to volley. It's exciting watching them learn new skills every Saturday! They are loving their classes and last week our daughter told us every one of the coaches high fived them as they left the court. The encouragement of words says a lot for children to continue to grow in a new sport and we have started to talk to the kids about the Australia Open!! @tennisaustralia @anz_au #ad #befit #stayactive #teachthemyoung”
