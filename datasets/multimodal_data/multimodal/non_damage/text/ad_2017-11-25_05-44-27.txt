Say bye to itchy scalp and dandruff forever!👋🏻 For you guys who didn’t know that I’ve been using hair extensions on/ off for almost a year now. Extensions can cause itchy scalp, so it’s very important to maintain a clean and healthy scalp.
I’m using “Neutrogena T/Gel Therapeutic Original Formula, Dandruff Treatment” shampoo to treat my scalp.

It works really great for me. My scalp is not itchy anymore. I felt the difference right after the first shampoo session. My scalp now feel clean and relieved.

It contains coal tar. Interestingly enough, I like the scent of the shampoo, it has a medicated smell, it has a strong smell but it makes my hair smells good after washing it.
Although I think the smell can be a bit overwhelming for some people.

This shampoo helps eliminate flakes immediately, preventing new flakes from forming, helps control itching, eliminating stubborn dandruff/ flaking caused by dandruff and soothing scalp discomfort.

I highly recommend to anyone struggling with dandruff/buildup and itchy scalp!

跟头皮发痒和头皮屑 永远 说拜拜!👋🏻 可能有些朋友不知道，其实我接发将近要一年了。接发很容易会引起头皮发痒，所以保持头皮的清洁健康是非常重要的。

我现在用的是“Neutrogena T / Gel Treatment Original Formula, Dandruff Treatment"洗发水来保养我的头皮。 
它对我来说真的很好用。我的头皮不再发痒了。在第一次使用后就感觉到很不一样。现在我感觉我的头皮比较健康，干净和舒服。

洗发水本身含有煤焦油。我很喜欢这洗发水的香味，它有点药味，虽然我觉得味道对某些人来说可能有点强，可是洗完后头发闻起来这十分香。

这种洗发水有助立即减少皮屑，防止新皮屑，有助控制瘙痒，消除由头皮屑引起的顽固性头皮屑/剥落和舒缓头皮不适。

我非常推荐任何有头皮屑或头皮痕痒问题的朋友使用!  第一次购买的朋友们 通过以上的网站 购买超过$20还可以享受$5的折扣!👆🏻 #ad #neutrogena #iHerb
