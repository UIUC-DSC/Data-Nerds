The Jack and Pup bully sticks are 100% digestible, all natural, gluten-free, non-greasy, Grass fed beef, and one of the best kinds of treats , a bully sticks you can give your dogs. And I choose to give these types of treats to my dogs because they are long-lasting they are natural they have no additional additives I know what is in the product, I need to be aware of these ingredients because my dog is diabetic. So these treats and this brand overall are great or would be great for other dogs with specific diet restrictions. my dog üêï Romeo is on a grain free, high-protein, and lowfat diet. So I am able to give him one of these as a treat without worrying that it would mess up his blood sugar and cause him to have any blood sugar reaction. My dogs and I are happy with this purchase.
