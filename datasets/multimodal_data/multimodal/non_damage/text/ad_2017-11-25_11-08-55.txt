This month sees the release of Disney’s latest short film, Olaf’s Frozen Adventure and we were very lucky to be sent the latest toys as we are proud to be working with Hasbro as part of their Toy Tribe. My children think that I have the best job in the world ever… and I would have to agree with them! Ha! I thought it would be easier to include all three toys together in one review so you can see the whole collection for yourself. It's up on the blog now! ❄️ #ad #hasbro #hasbrotoytribe #olafsfrozenadventure #disneyfrozen #toyreview #parentingblogger #linkinprofile
