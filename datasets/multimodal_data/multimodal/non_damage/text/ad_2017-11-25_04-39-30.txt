Relaxation is key to not losing your mind having 4 kids! This portable shiatsu massage pillow from Gideon is very helpful with gaining that relaxation. This massage pillow has four balls that rotate in a circular motion at the neck and shoulders. After a few minutes, the balls will stop moving and then change direction. It feels very good when it is massaging up my neck. The balls in the massager also have heat to help relax your muscles. 
The massager has a wide elastic that has has velcro on it so it can fit many different size chairs. I have even put it at an angle on my bed pillow laid my neck into it. It was great to see right before I went to bed to work out the knots in my neck. I even used it for my calves when they have felt restless. #Ad #IWasInvited
