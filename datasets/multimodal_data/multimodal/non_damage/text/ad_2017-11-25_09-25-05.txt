Botswana prep 🌾🦒🐆🐘🦓🌾 planning for a month away from home is hard but planning for a month without shops/ people/ outside world means I’m lugging all my essential with me. Including ALL of the hydrating lotions 💦💦💦 cause it’s V dry out there and I flake like Austin Powers Goldmember💰🌞🍯 on a good day. Currently using @minisoza Horse Oil handcream & Ginseng Moisture Essence face cream. #botswana #travels #africa #ad
