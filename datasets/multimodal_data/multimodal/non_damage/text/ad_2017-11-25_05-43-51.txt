This board is absolutely beautiful. The wood is polished and it is so shiny. It really looks like a piece of artwork.  The wheels are tough plastic and the top of the board is rough for grip. My son rode it up and down the sidewalk and it held his weight just fine.  This is a longboard, not a regular skateboard. Itâ€™s better for long runs downhill and turns smoother than a regular skateboard. It would be great for a teenager or an adult but probably too much board for a younger child.  A beginner could learn on it and a seasoned skater would appreciate the quality and workmanship. #iwasinvited #rimable #ad #invitedbyagleam #longboard
