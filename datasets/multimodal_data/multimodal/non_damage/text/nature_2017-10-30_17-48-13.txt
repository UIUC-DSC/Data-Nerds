One of my favorite moments from our last expedition to Indonesia!!! ðŸŒŠðŸ¦ˆðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨ "Another amazing face-to-face encounter our team had freediving in Indonesia for their most recent project on microplastics and other threats facing manta rays!

Our team was fortunate enough to explore the waters of Nusa Penida in Indonesia together with @marinemegafauna @queenofmantas @alice_in_waterland and @jannemanconradie We used our freediving expertise to spot new locations for acoustic receivers that are going to monitor the movement of manta rays in the region. In one of the bays we encountered this curious individual that swam up to @lukaswaterman . Luckily @williamwinram had a GoPro mounted to his mask and captured it!

In the days prior it was difficult for us to find individuals that were coming in close enough to have real close-up interactions. Part of that reason is the increasing tourism in the region and tourists not sticking to best practices. At one point we saw several snorkelers pushing the mantas to snap selfie-videos. It's critical to understand that manta rays are very social and intelligent animals, and may already be starting to avoid people." More updates on the project and films resulting from our work in Indonesia coming in the next weeks!
