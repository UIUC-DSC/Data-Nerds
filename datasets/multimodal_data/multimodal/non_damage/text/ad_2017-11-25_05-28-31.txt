This is why we do what we do. Not because of the bright lights and flashing cameras. Not for the lucrative paycheck. But for the opportunity to reach someone. Even if it's one person, peeing at a urinal at a hockey game, just looking for something to kill the time while they drain their hobgoblin. This is why we do this. #sponsored #ad #humansoflatecapitalism #gocaps
