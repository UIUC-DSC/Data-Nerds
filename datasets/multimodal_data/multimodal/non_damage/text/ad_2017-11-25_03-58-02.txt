My dogs love to chew! We purchased these Jack&Pup Premium Himalayan Yak Cheese Dog Chews Treat. My dogs loved them! They are a decent size treat and last a long time. I love that they have no odor and do not stain anything. They are ðŸ’¯ % digestible and safe. My vets office recommended we get natural treats like these. Some of my dogs have sensitive stomachs and treats give them issues but we have had great luck with all the products offered by Jack & Pup. I saw similar treats to these at a local pet store at a higher price. They are meat free and made from yaks milk. If you would like an affordable premium type treat for your dogs I would highly recommend these. We will be purchasing them again in the future.
