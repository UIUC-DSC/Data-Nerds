This is the first inverted umbrella I have ever tried, and it is awesome. I am not much of an umbrella person; I usually just wear a hoodie or two, but this may change my habits. It is very light and easy to hold with its ergonomic c handle. It has double layers and 8 reinforced ribs that can withstand winds up to 55mph, so it will take a lot to break this guy in a storm. There is a red button that makes opening and closing the umbrella really easily. It doesn't stick at all.

The best part about this inverted umbrella is that you never get wet while opening or closing it. All the water stays inside the umbrella, even when it is draining and drying out. It can even stand by itself, so it doesn't have to lean up against a wall. 
This umbrella would significantly be good at helping keep the kids dry when you are taking them to and from the bus stop, especially since it is 39" in diameter.
