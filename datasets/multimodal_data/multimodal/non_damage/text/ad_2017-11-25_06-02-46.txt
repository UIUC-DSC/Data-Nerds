Whose feet could use a good scrubbing?  I know mines can.  I look forward to the times that I go in for a pedicure just so I can get a foot scrub to help get rid of the dead dry layer of skin that tends to keep coming back between visits.  I was happy to come across the Calily Life Organic Anti Fungal Tea Tree Body and Foot Scrub with Dead Sea Minerals.  This 24 ounce bottle was plastic sealed under the cover to keep this oil based scrub from escaping before getting to you for use. 
Sat in my tub and used as a foot scrub at first.  Mixed the oil and grains so substance was not all oil which does rise to the top of the bottle.  It was very small grains so it wasn't scratchy on the skin.  The tea tree scent was subtle quite nice.  I decided to use it as a body scrub as well.  It left my skin pretty smooth with a nice glow.  I smelled quite good too!  I will try to keep up with a weekly use to help refresh my skin.  Not too bad for an in home treatment.
