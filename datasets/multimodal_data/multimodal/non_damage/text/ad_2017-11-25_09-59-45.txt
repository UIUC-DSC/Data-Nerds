Christmas is behind the corner and, as every year, I feel the urge to make all the typical treats of my area. It is part of my family tradition and I live this simple act of baking as a personal ritual to approach the festive season. I’ve begun with panforte, a spiced Medieval fruit cake, then a batch of ricciarelli, soft almond cookies so delicate and fragrant, to finish with cavallucci, these rustic and modest cookies which are a constant of my childhood memories. I baked them for @eridaniaitalia with their organic cane sugar, and if you want to bake them, too, you’ll be surprised by how easy they are: you need flour, lots of walnuts, a pinch of spices such as cinnamon, aniseed, nutmeg and coriander, a syrup made with water and sugar and candied orange peel to finish. You can find an old recipe in the blog archive! In the meantime, tell me, which are your favourite Christmas cookies?  #tropicalkitchen #ad
