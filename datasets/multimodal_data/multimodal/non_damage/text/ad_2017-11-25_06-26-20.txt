This bowl from PlayMeal is absolutely a great idea.  I have four kids under six, and they all have their picky eating habits, but my two year old is the pickiest of all.  I have been using this bowl with her, and she gets so excited to see what surprise is under all of her food, that she eats all of it. 
This comes with three wooden toys that are great, but with her being so young, they are not ideal for her.  The box does say not for kids under 3, so I do just use other things in there, like stickers or a cookie or something like that. 
If you are looking for a way to help your picky eater become excited about her food to find the prize, then check it out here:
