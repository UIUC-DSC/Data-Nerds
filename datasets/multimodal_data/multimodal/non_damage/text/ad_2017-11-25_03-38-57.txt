This is one of yet another great products from Gideon that I recently purchased. This one is unlike any other back massager I have seen or owned. As you can see, it has a handle to make carrying it easy, which is great because this is one substantial massager, with nothing flimsy about it! The 14 massage 'nodes' are situated just right so pretty much every part of your back will be subject to a deep shiatsu kneading. This back massager also has the option for heat along with your massage. Another feature, common with most Gideon massagers, this comes with a car jack plug, so you can bring this awesome massager along with you in the car. Talk about making a long trip more bearable! This shiatsu massager is an outstanding value for the price! It would make a great holiday gift, particularly for someone that experiences back pain.
