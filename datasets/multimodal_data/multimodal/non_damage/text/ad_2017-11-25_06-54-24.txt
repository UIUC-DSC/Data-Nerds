I recently bought a hand held massager, but I wanted to try this one for a few reasons. I like that most of the other hand held massagers this one is actually wireless, you just have to charge it and it’s ready to go. The beauty of the is that you don’t have to be stuck next to an outlet to get a massage from your love. You can take it anywhere. 
This Gideon wireless pulsating massager also has a long arm (handle) and that was the second reason I really wanted it. I am able to reach any part of my neck, shoulders or back without the help of anyone. 
The massager come with a charging base that has 2 spots for the massaging head attachments not being used. Overall I like this one better than the last simply because I can use it on myself, check it out here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B071FB1M3Y?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_pd
