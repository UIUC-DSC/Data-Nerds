So over a year ago I walk into Whole Foods looking for some ice cream when @halotopcreamery caught my eye- with their big “240 calories per pint” written for all curious eyes to see. I automatically reached for it and have been a fan ever since! I get away with eating a WHOLE pint of @halotopcreamery (guilt-free) when the same amount of calories would be only a few spoonfuls of other brands like Ben & Jerry’s. ALL NATURAL SWEETENER is the answer. And each flavor I’ve tried, I genuinely enjoy. So happy to see how far they’ve branched out! You won’t find this type of quality in other “healthy” ice creams 🍨😋🍦 #halotop #icecream #ad #sponser
