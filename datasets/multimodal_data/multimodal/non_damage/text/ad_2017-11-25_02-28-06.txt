I had such an amazing Friendsgiving! ðŸ¦ƒ I am so grateful for where I am, for my unpredictable and beautiful path, and for the people surrounding me who are making my journey so amazing. In a special note, Iâ€™m so grateful for my friend @cajuinaefrevo. She has been an incredible friend, especially in the few weeks when my world seemed to collapse. Thanks for always listening, for FaceTiming when I needed to cry, and for showing me that life doesnâ€™t happen the way we plan/want but there is always internal resources to overcome our struggles/fears and conquer all we need to be happy. You are such an inspiration and light! I hope you enjoy your @shiseido gift.
