You fall through centuries, learning and unlearning, finding and losing love, until one day you hit pause. You stop chasing that thing you ache for. You realize there is a soul-expanding, ever-flowing well of desire and fulfillment that can soothe you from the inside out, but whether you get to know it and keep it in another being is left to be seen. And you're okay with that. The moment you stop all the madness and the searching, the universe conspires to align with you, because you have finally let go of needing anything more than you need your self. Suddenly, love comes to you and lays its heart in your hands, trusting you to nurture it. It rests its beautiful, magical head in your lap, looks up at you and says hey, I'm here now and I'm not going anywhere. I would've traveled through another hundred thousand centuries for love like that. It's worth waiting for ❤️
