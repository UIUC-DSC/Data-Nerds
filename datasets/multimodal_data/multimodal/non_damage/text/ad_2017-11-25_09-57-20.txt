Good Morning, I wanted to start the day off with a very exciting post! Violet and I are so happy to be involved with @_baby_and_i here on Instagram ðŸ‘­ 
We are super excited that we have teamed up with them to help support and promote their new business and to help spread the word before their big opening in February 2018.
If youâ€™re a mama or mama to be looking for beautiful custom made keepsakes or personalised gifts for your babies and bumps, Iâ€™d definitely hop on over to their Instagram and give them a follow! Keep an eye out as February will be here before we know it! ðŸ“†
Itâ€™s so lovely being able to help out smaller businesses and I really hope myself and Violet are able to do just that ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
