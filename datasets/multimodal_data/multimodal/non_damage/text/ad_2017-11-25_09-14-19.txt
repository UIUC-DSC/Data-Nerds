Time to spree, be set free. Hooked up on the hidden gems and forgot about the realisation. Comforted by the space from reality but opened them curtains and saw the sun. Them iridescent lights opened my eyes too, I  choose to close my truth cause I didn't wanna see it... #breath #PimmsBrooke #writing #inmyhead #poet ðŸ–¤
