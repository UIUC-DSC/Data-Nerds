Hard times don't last, people do.
.
This year I experienced some of the darkest & brightest of times in my 26 years of life. .
You would never imagine going through a divorce, no longer having a home or job, no idea how youre going to pay your bills or feed your 5 fur babies let alone yourself and having to call your parents and say youre coming back home after 5 years. You would never think to wake up one day and your whole life change. But mine did... and I came out SO much stronger and confident to take on life not only because I have the most supportive parents & friends in the world but because I reconnected with this guy.
.
The guy I had the biggest crush on in highschool, the one I flirted with everyday in history class, the one who I forced to kiss me in the hallways but never actually dated. .
I wouldn't of believed it if I was told that I would find my perfect soulmate, the one who can make me smile when all I want to do is cry, the one who will be by my side no matter how hard things get after 10 years of not seeing or talking to each other and in my darkest of times. He raised me up, he made me believe in myself again. He brought me my GLOW back. And I'll forever be thankful for My Pinterest Perfect Man for that üíï .
Why am I going on this rant? Well, have you ever heard of @awesomenesstv? They have a show called Zac & Mia it's about two unlikely characters that come together in the midst of their toughest times - facing #cancer. They helped each other glow and grow again. And now they want to give back! .
#awesomenesstv wants to hear your #truestory about someone who helped you through your struggle. They are running a #contest now through December 6th to give one winner $5K to the #charity of your choice in honor of the person who made you #glow again üòç .
