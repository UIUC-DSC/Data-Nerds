My 4 year old daughter loves when her and I match. We wear the same clothes, wear the same silly glasses, or drink from the same cups! We have a set of emoji cups that we love very much and use quite often. However, my daughter being 4, chews on straws. These cups came with hard clear plastic straws that do not allow bending when pressure is applied. Therefore, the straw actually shattered. I Tried cutting down the straw so we can still match cups. I have been using the broken straw for a while now. I went to a local store and bought some generic straws but they fell out of the cup when pulled. .

I found these straws and thought it would be a great idea to give them a try. If they didn't work I could still use them for regular drinking cups. Well I am delighted to announce that these straws are PERFECT! The straws fit perfectly, just as the original straw did. I tried out all of the straws and they are consistent in size and quality. I am so happy that I made the choice to try these! Now my daughter and I can match again without me getting stabbed in the mouth with a jagged straw! üòÅ .

What I love about these straws are the quality. They are thick and durable. They will not shatter or cracck like the original straw did. They come in various colors and that keeps things fun! There are many colorful straws listed on amazon but what I love about these straws is they design will not come off! I had looked at other colorful straws that I wanted to try, that were more money, only to find people were complaining that the design comes off after washing. Not these straws though, the design is built into the straw so you never have to worry about anything falling off or chipping off into your mouth or into your drink! I hope I never lose these to my garbage disposal. Things love to fall in there. But if I ever have to buy more straws, I am going right back to these!
