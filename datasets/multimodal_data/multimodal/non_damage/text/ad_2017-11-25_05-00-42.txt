I love all salads! They are so healthy, colorful and flavorful. This salad is one of my favorites and one of the simplest and prettiest salads I make.  Here is the recipe for about two persons:⠀
1 fennel bulb thinly sliced⠀
1 persimmon thinly sliced⠀
1 small grapefruit in segments⠀
1  teaspoon chopped almonds⠀
1 teaspoon Organic Hydro-Therm Almond Oil from @florahealthy⠀
pinch of sea salt⠀
⠀
To prepare, arrange on a salad plate the fennel slices and the persimmon slices, top with the grapefruit segments, sprinkle the chopped almonds and finish by drizzling the almond oil.⠀
⠀
