People ask me what I do and how I got into it ALL THE TIME so I thought I'd post my story. I studied a Bachelor of Journalism at @uniofqld before getting an internship with @stylemagazines. I was close to graduating and didn't actually love the thought of sitting in a newsroom all day, but figured finishing with a piece of paper was better than accumulating a HECS debt for nothing. That internship was five years ago, and I quickly fell in love with the publishing industry. At Style, I sell and produce content marketing solutions for different businesses. My day-to-day includes client management, sales, creative concepts, editing mags/blogs/social content, styling shoots and (occasionally) cuddling furry friends at our Brisbane office. Newspapers may be dying, but the value of a journalism degree definitely isn't. My only regret is sleeping through every early morning class ðŸ˜‚ #studyjournalism #ad #UQ@uniofqldFind out more at http://hass.uq.edu.au/study_journalism
