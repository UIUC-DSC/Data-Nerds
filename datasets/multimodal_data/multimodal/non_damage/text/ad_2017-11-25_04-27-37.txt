Last 4 1/2 Years:

I have submitted over 72,000 pieces of #artwork, #poems, short #stories, #photography, concept jposters, "Pajama Time" #video, and #ad copy to... * #Imagr
* #Instagram * #Facebook * #Google+
* #Pinterest * #Tumblr
* #YouTube * #Sobergrid 
And
* #PicsArt 
All created on #android cellphones. Using #Verizon and #Cricket 
The phones being #hulwai #motorola #alcatel and #zte

All created by #adobephotoshopexpress #PicsArt, #zombodrod meme generator, and #zombodroid image combiner. 
I had to delete all but 6 of these because of space. Someday I'll have my PC, #Canon digital camera with all the bells and whistles, poster quality printer, and more. Cause AMEN it's gotta happen. 
And much of that on #freewifi 
These companies and such should be paying me. I should be getting endorsements or something.

Don't you think?

Love, 
Your Ricky <3 (HugsAndKisses) <3
