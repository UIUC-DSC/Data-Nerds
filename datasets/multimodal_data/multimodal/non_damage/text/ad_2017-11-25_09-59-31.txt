@fortysev_design : We decided to change our Rakurs. As of right now, we are the Design Studio “47”. Have you heard of Pirahã people? Throughout their lives - every tribe member, goes through a few name changes. 
Thoughts and opinions are ever changing. Why should one stick to one name? 
We were inspired by Pirahã Tribe’s wisdom, and decided to start a new chapter in our lives. 
We are absolutely ecstatic for our studio to be reborn. Designers’ heads are full of new ideas, with hands itching to create something even 47 times much better. 
Why 47?
- More than 47 satisfied clients - 47 months of hard work - 47 hours for a brand new and exclusive design
But in all honesty, we are just really fond of a number 47, and deemed it as fit for our studio. 
Here is to a new adventure! #design #graphicdesign #studio #newchapter #ad #fortyseven #designer
