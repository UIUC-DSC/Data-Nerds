Grey Cup is coming up this Sunday 🎉 so that means it's time to cheer on our Calgary Stampeders 🐴 and make it a "home-gating" night with friends and family. Keep it simple with some easy eats like the tasty 🍕🍕#CasadiMamaPizza!

You're probably surprised to hear that I love to eat grocery store pizza, but I probably keep 2-3 boxes stocked in my freezer at all times as it's a quick and delicious way to keep to my busy schedule. My favourite Casa di Mama flavours are the Hawaiian and Deluxe. Homemade pizza taste, just like Mama used to make!

Give home-gating a go as it's the next best thing to going to the game and all in the comfort of your own living room! I'll be watching the big game on the big screen, home-gating with Casa di Mama Pizza🍕🍕💛 on Sunday night so stay tuned for more pizza fun. #gostampsgo #greycup #cfl #ad
