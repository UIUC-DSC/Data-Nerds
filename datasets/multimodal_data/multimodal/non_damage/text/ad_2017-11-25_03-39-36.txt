"Fit is not a destination. It is a way of life"

I always want to stay fit but the biggest problem I face and which most of you also face for sure is I get the motivation to exercise but after sometime I tend to discontinue. But thanks to this Mio Global Slice Activity Tracker I always get the motivation since it allows to track my heart rate, total steps, calories burnt plus it even tracks my sleep at night. Plus obviously it is such a stylish watch by itself and notifies for a call or message. Check my new post in the link given in bio to know all about it plus how I have prepared my fitness schedule with this activity tracker.
