GLUTE ACTIVATION üçë
Having a peachy bum is top of the list for a lot of people at the moment, but activating your glutes before a workout is very beneficial to everyone!! In today's society a lot of people's bums have gotten lazy.. Spending lots of time sat on them! Having inactive glutes means they may not be firing up properly during our workouts.. This can cause lower back pain, hip pain and make us unable to lift heavy weights.
I always activate my glutes now, especially before a lower body session.
Give this circuit a go and let me know if you feel a difference - 20 reps of every movement üî•üçë #siansfitstop #gluteactivation #booty #building #muscle #feeltheburn #exercisevideo #workoutvideo #peachy
