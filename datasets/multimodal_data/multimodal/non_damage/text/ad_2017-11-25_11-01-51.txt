Another AWESOME #Gideon #massager that I'm really feeling. It's model GD-MSG-CS2. it's a programmable, #luxury, customizable, full back chair massager. It has shiatsu and rolling massage modes. The seat has a vibration mode for those tired tush cheeks. You can have the massage on your full back, upper back, lower back or programmed to one specific trouble spot. It even has a heat option!

When the heat is on, the balls glow red. They glow blue when it's off. The balls and either gently roll up and down or they can curve around in patterns to mimick a shiatsu massage and break up tense spots. It's even on a timer function so you don't over do it!
I wouldn't recommend laying on top of it, even though it's got a 110v home plug as well as a car adapter.  I've found a much more comfortable way to get the optimal laid down home use.
So basically I lay on my stomach and lay the massager on my back, then a take a sheet and lay it over the top, tucking it in tight under me. The sheet keeps the massager from moving around while it does what it does! #geniuslevel #lifehack
