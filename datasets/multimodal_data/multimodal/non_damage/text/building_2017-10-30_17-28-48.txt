Sneak peek alert!!! Architecture is a dream to paint in the miniature style and I am happy to live this dream with open eyes. Wish I could share more of this piece. Its taken 20 hours and I am probably painting at an unrealistic (too fast) pace at the moment. The production is as much about the paintings as it is about the projections and the dance. Curious how it will all turn out?!? Well, then get your tickets. www.BrokenSeeds.com 
Only 3 weeks to the Premiere Nov. 16-19. 🙏🏼🤓😎.
