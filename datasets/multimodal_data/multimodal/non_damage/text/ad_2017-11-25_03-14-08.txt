I was trying to remove some wall paper from a room that we are redoing and read it would be easier to get down with a steamer so I purchased this Gideon Handheld Pressurized Portable Steam Cleaner. It’s a perfect size to do jobs around the house yourself. You can use it to clean and disinfect, or to remove wrinkles. It comes with all the attachments you need. I like it because it is light weight and easy to carry around. The cord is also a nice length it’s nine feet long. I think my next project will be to clean the inside of my oven with this. The things you can use the to clean are limitless it really is a handy little steamer! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a nice lightweight steamer that is easy to use!
