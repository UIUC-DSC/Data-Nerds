#ad #IWasInvited #massage #health #wellness #acupuncture I absolutely love this foot massager! I am on my feet a lot at work, like a lot! My feet are so sore and tired at the end of my day or night of work. This massager combines acupuncture, shiatsu massage and heat. There is no going wrong with this awesome machine. This has a simple press button control so you don't even have to bend down to turn it on or off, you can press the buttons with your feet. The heat is very relaxing, and there are 4 massage nodules on each foot pad. The acupuncture on the heel and toes area helps with relaxing the muscles in your feet as well. This also has three speeds. I love this massager and so does my husband. Even my boys like this! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075CWQDCR/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
