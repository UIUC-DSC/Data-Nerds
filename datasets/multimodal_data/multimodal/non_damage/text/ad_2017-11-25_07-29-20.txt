The Gideon Spa 🧖🏻‍♀️ acupuncture and shiatsu foot massager is great for a tired aching feet. Especially for people who are on their feet all day. 🙋🏻‍♀️ The massagers have heat they rotate clockwise or counterclockwise three hundred sixty degrees. There are two buttons, one is for heat and the other is the power and speed. The speed button has a low setting, a medium setting and a high setting. You can have the heat on or off. The power button is on the base of the massager. There are small spike looking things that make your foot massage so much nicer. The pressure from you foot and body gives it just the right amount to give an acupuncture like treatment. I think this is totally made for hot mess moms like me.
