#ad I've been baking for a festive cake sale this weekend, and instead of gingerbread men, wanted to make something just a little bit different.  So what do you think of these little beauties?! These #vegan Gingerbread & Apple Baked Donuts are topped with either cinnamon sugar or cinnamon icing - so pretty, festive and really tasty too! I hope they sell well.  Top quality cinnamon from @schwartz.uk is all-important when it is the star of the show like this - my favourite Christmas spice!  #TasteofChristmas #Schwartz
