Great balls of fire! I mean whiskey- or maybe bourbon.  Itâ€™s no secret I love my kitchen gadgets and especially cool stuff for the bar. I ordered these big balls of steel designed for your whiskey to keep it nice and chilled.

First off they are freaking gorgeous! They would look sleek in any drink you put them in. They are made of stainless steel and all you have to do is simply freeze them for four hours before using them and then you just rinse them with water and let them dry before reusing them. Drop 1-2 in your drink and it instantly starts chilling your drink. I used all four of them because I like my drinks to be ice cold like Antarctica. I really like these, and plan to use these for when we have dinner guests to add a fancy elects to dinner drinks.
