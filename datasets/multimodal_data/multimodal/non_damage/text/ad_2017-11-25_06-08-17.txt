Lemmy
In 1969, before Lemmy joined Hawkwind, a friend convinced his nurse girlfriend to sneak them some amphetamine sulfate from the dispensary where she worked. She accidentally brought home a jar of atropine sulfate. Lemmy did a teaspoon full, which he said was "200 times the overdose," and then everyone "went berserk." In his memoir White Line Fever he recalled talking to a TV held under his arm, then passing out and waking up in the hospital. "If we got you in another hour you would have been dead," the doctor told him. Even after being treated, he had sporadic hallucinations for two weeks and recalled, "sitting, reading a book, and I'd turn to page 42 â€“ but there was no book."
