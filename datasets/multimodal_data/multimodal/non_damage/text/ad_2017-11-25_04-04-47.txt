With all the Black Friday shopping I did today, I couldn’t let Hailey feel left out! She’s loving her new @goodthreadsllc needlepoint collar and I’m loving how this brand gives back with a significant portion of each sale going towards meals for children! As you do your holiday shopping, don’t forget about the brands out there that pay it forward! #goodthreadsllc #ad
