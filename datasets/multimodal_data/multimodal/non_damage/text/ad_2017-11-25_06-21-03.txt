Who knew how much Id love a wireless massager? I'm not comfortable laying down and having a stranger massage me- I just don't see how I'd relax and then what's the point? But I never tried a personal massager either, until now. I love that this is wireless I can literally take it anywhere and not be limited to how long the cord is. It has a great charging base with different attachments and while at first glance I was skeptical of it actually feeling good, it does wonders on sore muscles and pressure points. Last night I slept wrong and woke with a kink in my back, I used the massager and it felt ten times better. Try it, you'll thank me later!
