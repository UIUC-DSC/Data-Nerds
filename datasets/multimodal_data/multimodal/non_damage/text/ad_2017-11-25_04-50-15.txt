Double post because I can haaaaaa but big big thanks to @ghostek_products for letting me try out their brand new Exec 2 Series case! When Iâ€™m shooting, I already have SO much gear to carry around and honestly my wallet is kind of a hassle (I also misplace it all the time). This case fits up to 5 cards and even some cash which makes my life way easier. Muhaha. | #Ghostek #livewirelessly #iPhone7plus and yes this is an #ad |
