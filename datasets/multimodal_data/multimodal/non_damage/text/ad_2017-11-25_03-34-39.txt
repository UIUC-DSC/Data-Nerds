Eliminator’s Electronic Fly and Bug Zapper. My son has a weird bug allergy. It’s a common bug, that left him with full body blisters, and more, and so, was put on steroids and antibiotics. So, he is highly bug phobic, and we are always looking for a way to eliminate any and all from around our home. This Fly and Bug Zapper Is a great way to do this, without chemicals too. This bug zapper plugs into a regular outlet. It uses only 20 Watts to operate, so is affordable to use. It is stated to cover a 5000sq. foot area, which covers a great deal around your patio area. It can be used indoors or outdoors. Just make sure the plug is well covered, and protected. This unit measures out at 15 x 12 x 3 inches. The two, 10 Watt UV bulbs are replaceable, which is great. Less waste this way. This does not give off an odor in use. Make sure you clean off the bugs, lol. Unplug it first, of course. The cord is only around 4ft long. Overall, a very handy unit. I am so pleased with it.
