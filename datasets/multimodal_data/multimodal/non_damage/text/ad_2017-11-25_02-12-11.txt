#ad #IWasInvited #massage #health #wellness #relaxation I have received quite a few different massage cushions in the past couple weeks, but this is one of my favorites. This particular cushion targets every part of my back from shoulders to hips. I have only been using this every other or third day because getting used to the shiatsu has left me pretty sore. It's a good kind of sore though. My back feels looser and I don't have as many knots under my shoulders as I did before. This cushion also has heat. I love the heat because that really helps with relaxation. This has plug ins for home and car, and is compact so it's easy to travel with. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071P2B4N1/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
