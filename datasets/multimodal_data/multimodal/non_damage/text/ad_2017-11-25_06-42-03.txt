This AquaAudio Cubo portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker totally exceeded my expectations. After seeing a facebook ad pop up on my wall, I immediately jumped on it. It arrived within 2 days and the moment I turned it on, a clear, crisp sound emitted from the speaker.  The sound quality was sharp and I swear you could not tell the difference from this brand to a competing brand you would normally pay more for. Quality and make was on par and very durable. It definitely has a nice weight to it. 3 inch X 3 inch.  My only complaint is that there was no string or clip to allow the speaker to hang from a high point especially since I like to go do a lot of outdoor things with the family. This speaker is excellent for outdoor events, bbqs, or workouts at the gym. 10 hours of playing time on a single charge. People around my office are already asking where and how much I bought this speaker for. I'm definitely a satisfied customer and can't wait to see what other products AquaAudio will bring us.
