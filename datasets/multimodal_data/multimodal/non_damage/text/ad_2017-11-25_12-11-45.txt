I just saw this funny film from Uber showing what situations we can get into because of heavy traffic, People spend hours being stuck in traffic and yet, more and more cars are being registered every day. And every time I’m stuck in traffic, I just think about the many different ways I could enjoy the moment rather than being kept in a tiny space surrounded by other cars.🚗💨 In fact, we could even save 5 days a year if more people share fewer cars. And now imagine what you could do in 5 days… ❤ #unlockvienna #ad // Sponsored post //
