Oh man, I thought I died and went to heaven the first time I turned this massaging cushion on. I put it on top of another black comfy chair that has a stool. The chair tilts back and we turn this on and just sleep and/or veg out. You can really feel the pressure. My neck is like a rock all the time, and this Gideon Shiatsu Massaging Cushion has helped my neck and back immensely. 6 program fully customizable control.  Did I mention it also has heat? Yes, heat! To be honest, the first time I used it, I did end up bruised and couldn't use it again for a  few days. However, if you go to a massage therapist and get a good deep tissue massage, the same thing is likely to happen. It's just your body reacting to having sore muscles moved around and does not speak at all to the product.  Don't hesitate to buy this if you are looking for a wonderful massager.
