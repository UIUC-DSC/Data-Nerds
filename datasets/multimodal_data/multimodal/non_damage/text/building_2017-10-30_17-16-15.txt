Concept visualization for the Newfoundland and Labrador Construction Association (NLCA). The project, located in the city of St. John’s, encompasses a 10,500 square-foot, one storey building, made up of a centralized block flanked by two outward-facing wings. 
The design aims to establish a monolithic lower piece, with a bright central extrusion, akin to a glowing box. The concept celebrates the contrast of the various building elements. The building’s exterior wall is to be comprised of charcoal-coloured architectural stone, with the central block being clad in a curtain wall finish.
