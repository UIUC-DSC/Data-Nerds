Everyone loves a good foot massage! I bought this 
Gideon Shiatsu and Acupuncture Foot Massager with Infrared Heat and it is amazing! It has mini massaging balls that work wonders for tired achy feet. I put Mom near my bed so when I wake up I just put my feet on it for a few minutes and it gets me going. The heat adds a pampering effect. I think this would be a wonderful birthday or Christmas gift for someone. Itâ€™s very nicely made and sturdy. I Think the size is perfect also , you can slide it under the bed to keep out of the way if you needed to. I highly recommend this foot massager for anyone who has foot pain , or heel pain. It has worked wonders for me and I love it! You can check it out here : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075CWQDCR
