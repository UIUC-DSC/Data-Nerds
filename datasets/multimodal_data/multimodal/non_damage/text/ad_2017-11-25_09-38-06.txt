The Gideon Deep Kneading Massage Pillow is definitely working well for me.  It is a pillow with two connected Massaging balls on each side.  It is great for those mornings when I get out of bed with neck or back pain and it happens for no apparent reason except for the fact that I woke up.  I think this is what people meant when they say it’s old age.  The pillow has become my goto therapeutic tool to help with my pains.  The balls in the pillow rotate in either direction applying heat with one direction.  There’s also a strap on the back to secure its position on the chair I’m sitting on.  But besides working so well, the pillow is portable and I can use it in my car if I want to, with the conveniently provided car adaptor.  #ad #IWasInvited. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00ZDOAVHA/ref=mp_s_a_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1511595324&sr=8-4&keywords=gideon+shiatsu+deep+kneading+massage+pillow&dpPl=1&dpID=51rdblV0ZzL&ref=plSrch
