For me, it’s very important to practice self-love💓.And since the weekend is coming, I always treat myself to a day of self-care✨, which includes applying my favorite skincare products and relaxing at home💆🏻. Scrubs are essential products, in my opinion. I've been trying the @albabotanica Acenodote Face + Body scrub 🌿 and I only have good things to say about this product. It's dermatologist tested and infused with salicylic acid and willow bark extract to fight existing acne and prevent future breakouts. I struggle with breakouts a lot and my skin is very sensitive, but this scrub is so gentle on my skin. I seriously love it, plus it leaves my skin so soft! 💕Continuing with my skincare essentials, I've been loving the @albabotanica Fast Fix for a Pimple. This product is a true lifesaver. I apply it to conceal blemishes and it's lightly tinted, which is aaamazing!🙌🏼It works and conceals at the same time. I'm sure you're going to love these products! 💘 #DoGoodDoBeautiful #ad
