This charcoal mask feels like a cool mud mask when applied to your face. It has a thick yet smooth consistency. I applied the mask with a face spatula which provides nice even coverage. The masks stays wet on your face, it does not dry out or crack and it does not sting. I left it on my face for about 20 minutes. My skin looked brighter and felt smoother after the first application. I prefer charcoal masks for the detox benefits that they provide. This mask is packed with ingredients to help penetrate your skin to clear up blemishes and leave you skin clear and smooth. I kind of wish they offered this in a larger tub because I would apply from my shoulders/chest upwards.
