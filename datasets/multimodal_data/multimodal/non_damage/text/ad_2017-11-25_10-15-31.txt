Ok so I'm sure you're all wondering what's happening here! Holidays are stressful, stress increases my pain levels, ya girl isn't a fan of pain! So I bought back massagers. A lot of back massagers. OK eight. 3 different styles. Each a little bit different from the one before. Stress be gone!
This one is the #Gideon #Shiatsu #DeepKneeding #massage pillow with heat.

I bought it so I could have a nice relaxing neck massage in the car - one I could slip on my head rest without committing to it pressing into me the entire time, and its absolutely great for that. It comes with a home 110V plug for home as well as a car adapter so it can be used anywhere, anytime.
The heat is optional, flip the simple switch one way - massage. Flip it the other - massage AND heat.
I discovered a nice bonus with this one. I have carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis in both wrists/forearms. My wrist fits perfectly between the two shiatsu rollers and the massager provides perfect pressure. When the gentle heat is added in, I get so much relief! I don't even have to wear my wrist braces if I remember to give five minutes to the massage pillow after typing, cooking, or being alive and functioning a few hours.

I'm really enjoying this one, but keep checking in for a barrage of massagy things to get you through rough times!
