Check out my little Tennis Pros! ðŸŽ¾ 
I have to say watching my boys playing the sport that Sam and I both grew up playing passionately is pretty special to the both of us. We signed the boys up for the Spring/Summer ANZ Tennis Hot Shots program at one of our local courts just near home. It was super easy to sign up and they were both so excited! This is Roccoâ€™s first ever attempt at playing any type of sport so I was a little apprehensive at how he would go, but he totally owned it! The courts are smaller, which makes it easier for little ones to play and participate. He actually hit the ball over the net quite a few times and he may have also hit his very patient coach in the head a few times too ðŸ™ˆ 
Samâ€™s dreams of having one of his sons play tennis professionally may be looking a little brighter! ðŸ˜œ #tennishotshots @tennisaustralia @anz_au #ad
