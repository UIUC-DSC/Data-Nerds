#ad #findyourfit @idealfit There are going to be days where you're just unmotivated almost everyone gets them and you want to change it before it keeps becoming the bottom of the list. Make workouts a priority change things around if needed get creative to be on the move. I found working out first thing in the morning works best for me and I'm no morning person at all! But it helps being more productive through the day when you start it off with a workout.
