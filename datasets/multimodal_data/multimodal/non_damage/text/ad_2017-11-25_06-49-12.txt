It makes me incredibly happy when I have fellow stylists in my chair I went to beauty school with. You guys, This girl is CRUSHING the mom and makeup artists game. Her hair needed a mommy makeover so I blended her existing balayage with baby lights around her face and toned her with a yummy fall rich mocha. Wam bam thank you ma'am she's ready for this holiday season. #nofilter
