I love this machine and my husband too.The Gideon Shiatsu have 8 balls and I think it is more kneading, it really feels like you are getting a massage. The balls feel just like a thumb working out the knots. One ball is a little smaller than the other so as they rotate you get a soft touch then the bigger ball comes around and goes a little deeper.You don't really realize it until this works it's magic on your muscles. I always use it with the heat , it's amazing and it vibrates too. It comes with cords to both plug into a standard outlet or into your cars I would highly recommend this product.
