TRUTH= There is no magic pill, body wrap, tea or shake that will make you burn fat, it will drain you out for a while and then all the fluid will go back on.
Moderation is key, health isn't defined by one single thing you do or eat, health is a lifestyle as a whole. No one ever got skinny from eating one salad just like no one got fat from eating one donut . Health and overall fitness success is about being moderate in your approach of what works best for you!!! .
