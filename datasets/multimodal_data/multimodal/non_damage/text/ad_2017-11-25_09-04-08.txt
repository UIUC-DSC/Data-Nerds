My husband is a hard to buy for guy, finding a gift for him can be challenging. So I thought of getting him something useful for his office. He hardly gets the chance to leave the office and works extremely late. Though when he does it’s still work duties. He loves his coffee and usually takes a case of Dr. Pepper into work with him at times. Then it dawned on me, a little refrigerator for his office to keep his soda cans chilled. 
The search was on, as I scoured several websites when I finally came across this cute little Uber XL mini fridge that would be a perfect gift. It came in a couple of colors, Red, Silver or Matte Black, I chose Gun Metal for him. It can hold up to 12 cans of drinks and a few snacks that need to be kept chilled.

It also comes with both a 110v ac wall plug and a 12v dc plug for your car, home,camper, man cave or wherever you choose to use it. Another great feature it has is, there’s switch on the back you can choose to cool your drinks to 32*F degrees below ambient temperature or keep your food WARM to 135*F. This is perfect because he often does not have time to run out and grab lunch! So now I can pack warm lunches for him instead of a cold sandwich. 
It has a nice sleek and compact design and feel to it. The internal dimension run roughly 8.25” W x 5.25” D x 9.75” H. This is perfect for his needs. And I don’t have to worry if he has a a warm lunch, snack or drinks when he works late. One perfect, unique Christmas gift down for the husband. Now I need to go wrap it up, thanks Uber Appliance! 
This would also make a ideal gift for the teen or soon to be college student.
