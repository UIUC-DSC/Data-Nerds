I have always loved listening to music in the shower or while I’m doing my hair and makeup. I’ve mainly used my phone just leaving it on the bathroom counter, well it’s hard to hear it in the shower at times, until now. 
I bought the Aqua Radio Cubo, the sound quality is great and there is a wide range of volume. The speaker is rear facing so it really resonates well off the wall. It is surprising loud for a small speaker too and has really rich tones with good bass. I can easily skip a song or repeat a song, adjust the volume, pause, play, and even take phone calls. When using it for phone calls, there is a time delay of about a second. Not a huge deal for me though. I don't plan on using it to talk on the phone much while I'm in the shower. 
Before I received my Cubo, I was concerned that I would need to keep re-applying the suction cup just to keep the unit from crashing to the floor. But the suction cup is nearly as large as the speaker, and it has held solidly in place, even despite getting a tiny wet every day. I love this little Bluetooth shower aqua radio.
 If you are looking for a quality shower speaker this is the one. You will not be disappointed! It will also make a perfect gift for a teen or hard to buy husband or wife.
