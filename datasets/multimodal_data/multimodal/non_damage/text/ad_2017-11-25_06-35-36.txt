I'm addicted to this Gideon shiatsu massager cushion. The only time I have gone any length of time without using it is the weekend I went out of town for work. From the first use when I was all knots I was hooked. I lent it to my father in law for 1 day and he was hooked. Other than that, it lives on my desk chair in my office and I use it every day--sometimes multiple times a day.
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT is that there are 2 rollers for neck and multiple rollers for back--so you can target what's sore. The back rollers do shiatsu and rolling; the neck rollers only do shiatsu, but you can adjust their height for your body. The heat function is especially nice if you are achy. It feels like a hug.
WHAT COULD BE BETTER is the vibrating seat. I don't mind the vibration, but it doesn't seem to be at a functional location, no matter where I put it. I can never get it under my butt so it vibrates my legs which is just odd. It's not a detraction, per se; I certainly would not stop using my massager because of the seat; but version 2.0 has room for improvement.
