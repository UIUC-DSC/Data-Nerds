“I'm always asked, 'What's the secret to success?' But there are no secrets. Be humble. Be hungry. And always be the hardest worker in the room.” - Dwayne Johnson.  Nothing has ever come easy for me. Luckily I was raised with an exceptional work ethic that continues to motivate and drive me to never give up.  Everything I have came from pure hard work, determination and perseverance.  I was never the smartest, fastest or richest.  I came to this country and started my life all over again at the age of 29.  Now I’m 47 and am humbled by the journey.  There is more satisfaction in earning not taking.  Many times I wanted to quit.  Instead I worked harder.  So when you feel like giving up, don’t.  Believe in yourself and all is possible🙌🏼. Xoxo and Aloha from Hawaii🌸. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
