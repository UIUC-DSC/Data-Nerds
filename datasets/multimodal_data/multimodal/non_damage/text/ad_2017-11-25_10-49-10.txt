I'm certainly not about to take the moral high ground as far as kids with gadgets are concerned - after all, I was on breakfast TV admitting I allow my kids to get teched-up during mealtimes (sometimes!) - but it's about balance and rules (which aren't always the easiest to implement mid-supermarket with a tantrum-ing toddler who just wants his Peppa fix!). We use pads, smart phones and TVs in our lives to make things a little easier and give the boys some downtime in between their crazy football schedule. Check out my latest blog (link in bio) to find out what we thought of the @argos Alba collection of really affordable tech! A purse friendly, child safe alternative to the gizmos you might be considering this Christmas?! #AD #weloveagadget #bewareoftheearmworms #GetItToday â€‹#argos #mumofboys #raisingboys
