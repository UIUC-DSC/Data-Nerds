My friends at @awesomenesstv have a new show called Zac and Mia  that you should all check out. It's a sweet show about two teens that have cancer, and how they help each other through it. You can watch it at @go90 for free! This girl right here has helped me trough some hard things in life, she has truly helped me #glow into the person I am today. Make sure to go follow @awesomenesstv and enter their $5K donation contest! You could win $5,000 to a charity of your choice. The contest closes on December 6th, so hurry up and enter! #zacandmiashow #contest #mystory #trustory #hbtsp #awesomenesstv #hbtawesome #ad
