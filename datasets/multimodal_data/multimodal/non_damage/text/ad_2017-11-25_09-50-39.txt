Decorating the Christmas tree in matching @happyhannas #hannajams and sharing some of our favorite Christmas traditions on the blog today!!! I want to hear your favorite traditions too, tell me some of yours in the comments! It is so fun to start your own traditions when your kids are young - we had so much fun writing down all the fun things we want to do each year with these kiddos. #ad #selftimer
