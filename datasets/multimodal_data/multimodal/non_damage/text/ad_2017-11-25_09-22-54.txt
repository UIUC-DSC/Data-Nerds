At the @femaledailynetwork event with @h2_healthandhappiness @h2celebratelife event! We talked about dull skin and pigmentation! Something that is very close to my heart. One of the main reasons that cause dull skin and pigmentation is broken skin lipid barriers. It might sounds so complicated but it’s as simple as treating your skin right by using the right product (low pH cleanser or just one that isn’t too high, moisturise and protect). #h2healthandhappiness #h2beautifulinsideout #fdxh2 #ad
