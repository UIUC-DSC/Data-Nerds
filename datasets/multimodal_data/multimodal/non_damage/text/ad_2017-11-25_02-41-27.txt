If you've never tried one of these, you really owe it to yourself to. It is both relaxing and invigorating and just a great way to relieve stress. There's a multitude of settings to choose from so you can customize for the massage you want. The tapping percussion massage really penetrates deep to loosen tight muscles and the deep kneading function feels like real hands for a more soothing experience. I like to use the heat feature for a before bed massage. It's easy to use. The demo button will walk you through a whole range of features and the controls light with each transition so you can see how it operates. The highest settings are intense so I recommend starting off slow and easing into it. You will feel like you just spent a fortune for a  therapist. The shut-off timer feature is great if you don't want to worry about falling asleep in your chairs. There's also an extra power adapter so you can use it in the car.
