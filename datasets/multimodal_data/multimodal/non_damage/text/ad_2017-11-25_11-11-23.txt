La Luna Smart Interactive Baby Soother  is a nice concept. It has a cry sensor, so when the baby cries it plays a shushing sound to help calm the baby. Similar to a noise machine. On auto, when it senses a baby cry it starts low increasing to a higher tone after ten seconds of the baby continuing to cry.  The volume is also  adjustable.  I like that you can record your own voice or sound up to fifteen seconds if you prefer. So you could either record a different soothing sound or you can record yourself singing a lullaby or even just a shushing sound. I think hearing a parents voice would be more soothing then the prerecorded sound. But that is my opinion.
The soother can be hung on the crib or anywhere in the room, you could even take it with you in the car and hook it onto the infant seat. Get one for yourself or as a baby shower gift today at the link below: #ad #iwasinvited
