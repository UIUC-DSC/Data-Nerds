Caught in the act prepping my post workout shake - do you know why having a protein shake post workout is beneficial? Solid food takes longer to break down inside your body, meaning it will take longer for the nutrients to get to your muscles. I usually try and have my shake within 30 mins of completing my workout! Do you use a protein supplement? Which one and when do you take it?! I would love to know! -
