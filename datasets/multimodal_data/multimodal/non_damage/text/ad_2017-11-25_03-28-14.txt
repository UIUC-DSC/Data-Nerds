I have dyed my hair many times over the years so deep conditioning treatments and masks have become a monthly sometimes weekly ritual. For a simple DIY mask I use either coconut oil or sunflower oil. Both moisturize well, however they can get messy. I recently tried Calily Lifeâ€™s Argan Oil Hair Mask. The mask comes in large container. It reminds me of a super thick conditioner. It has a very light clean smell to it. The directions advise to put on clean damp hair and let sit for 10-15 minutes. I prefer putting masks or oil treatments onto dry hair and working it into the scalp, then brushing it through to the ends. Once it is worked through I throw my hair up in a bun and then I normally clean my house letting the mask sink in anywhere from 2-4 hours. I was really surprised at how utterly silky soft this mask left my hair. Unlike a coconut or sunflower treatment this did not leave my hair feeling greasy. I think this would work really well for most hair types, however if you do not use hair masks frequently I would use per the directions listed on the bottle. See the link below for additional details and reviews.
