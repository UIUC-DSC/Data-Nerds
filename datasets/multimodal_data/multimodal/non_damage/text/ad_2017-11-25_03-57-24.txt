I purchased this PlayMeal Kid's Adventure Food Bowl as a gift for my friend. Her grand daughter just moved in and she won’t sit still long enough to eat. She get bored too fast and starts to fuss when it’s meal time. She came over for a visit today and I pulled his bowl out to see how it would do. We put the toy in the bottom and then put some vegetables in her bowl. As soon as she saw the toy peaking out under the vegetables she was very curious. I told her he toy can’t come out until she ate all her food. It worked pretty good! Her grandma was very impressed at how she sat eating without making a fuss. She was very curious to see this toy and ate all of her food! If you have a fussy eater I would recommend this bowl! You can check it out here : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MYRMILR
