Before Hurricane Irma. 
Itâ€™s truly heart breaking to think that I was here a month or so before the hurricane hit. It really make you appreciate the moments you have because in the second second all can cease to exist. Prayers are still going out to all that was affected and continue to be affected by the lost of their home/land.
