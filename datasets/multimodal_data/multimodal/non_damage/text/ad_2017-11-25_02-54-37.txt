Do you prefer to shop in person or online for Black Friday? 🖤 For me I prefer online deals since they’re usually much better than the ones in person, and I don’t have to worry about a bloodbath to get inside the store! 😂😩 One of the best Black Friday online deals I’ve seen is from @danielwellington who I received this beautiful striped pink watch from. They’re having a fantastic deal where you can get a free strap with the purchase of any watch! Be sure to use my code FLEUR15 to get an additional 15% of your order! Happy Holiday shopping 😍💖#DWForEveryone #ad #danielwellington
