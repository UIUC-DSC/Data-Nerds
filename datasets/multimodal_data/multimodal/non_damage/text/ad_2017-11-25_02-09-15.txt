So these beer glasses from Chill-O are pretty awesome, I ordered them for my honey who likes to come home from work and relax with a beer. 
The beer glasses are double walled and the inside shape is of a bullet. I popped the beer glasses into the freezer and went about my cleaning, a few hours later I came back and pulled out a mug, it immediately frosted up as soon as it hit the air outside of the fridge. The glass hold a full 12 oz beer, and after a few minutes the frost is clear enough to see the actual bullet shape in the first wall of the beer glass, but still was frosty enough to keep it cold. After 20 minutes my beer was still ice cold and fresh. 
I would definitely recommend these for a Christmas present for the beer lover in your life or a gin enthusiast who likes cool gear, you can find them here:
