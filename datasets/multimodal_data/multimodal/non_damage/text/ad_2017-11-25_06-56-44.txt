‚úñÔ∏èWEEKENDS‚úñÔ∏è
The weekends are generally where most people ruin their progress because they fall out of routine. During the week, if you have fixed working hours, it is much easier to follow a disciplined schedule where getting up, preparing your meals, eating them, doing your cardio and training all fall into place. On the weekends, where your schedule isn't set, it can be all too easy to fall behind. 
Here are some common weekend mistakes people make... 1. Getting Up Too Late
Getting up too late on the weekend can instantly set you back because you've missed a meal and the chances are you won't eat enough all day (of the right foods!). It also means that your body clock is knocked out of sync which can effect sleep quality, recovery and even hormone release. It's far better to keep a consistent bed time and wake up time all through the week, where possible. Yes, work might dictate these changes but laziness shouldn't be the reason!! 2. Not Preparing Food
Since the weekend offers more freedom, people abuse this and become complacent, forgetting to prepare meals and ultimately falling behind. If you're going out with loved ones on the weekend that's great but make sure you're prepared! - Take your prepared meals with you
- Make sure the place you're going to has suitable food on the menu (this is easy to check!!) - Keep a convenient meal replacement shake with you so there's no friggin' excuses whatever happens!

There's absolutely not excuses for missing your meals!

3. Being Inactive 
Due to a lack of routine, people tend to become less active on the weekends. Even if it isn't a training day, you need to get outside and do some form of exercise for general health including your cardiovascular system, gut function as well as fat loss. Being active outside also has many mental health benefits!
