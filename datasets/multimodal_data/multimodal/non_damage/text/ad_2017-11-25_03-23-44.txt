You don't need to spend a fortune for a massage therapist. This massager does the trick in the comfort of your home, office, and can even be used in the car with the special adapter. The massage ball travels up and down your back, circles in different directions, and counters back so it really feels like actual hands. The vibrating cushion and heat setting adds a whole new level to the experience. You can choose if you want a full back massage or if you want to target just upper or lower back. The full back setting is really thorough and extends from right above the hip to the shoulders. There's an auto shut-off feature for safety as well. It's a great way to relieve stress and it's incredibly relaxing. View more here at www. Amazon.com/gp/product/B075CD1W17 #ad #iwasinvited #f&wtradingllc
