Elacra’s Glass Food Storage Containers with Locking Lids. This is a set of 6 containers with locking lids. The containers are made out of a thick, heat-resistant borosilicate glass, and the lids are made out of BPA free plastic. They are oven and freezer safe. They can go into the microwave and dishwasher. I always hand wash my dishes, but just place the lids on the top shelf. The lids are not oven safe, or microwave safe. Just use a plate cover or press and seal when using one in the microwave. Since the lids are leak proof, they are perfect for taking food on the go, and storing it as well. The lids lock in place on all 4 sides, and this helps to ensure that your food will stay fresher, longer. Here are the sizes: 28 oz (7.3 x 5 x 2.6"), 23 oz (5.7 x 5.7 x 2.7"), 19 oz (5.4 x 5.4 x 2.5"), 11.4 oz (4.8 x 4.8 x 2”), 11.4 oz (4.8 x 4.8 x 2"), and 11.2 oz (5.2 x 3.9 x 2"). Overall, I am really happy witht his set, and they will be getting a lot of use.
