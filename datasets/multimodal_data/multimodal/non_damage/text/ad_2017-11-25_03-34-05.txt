GIdeon Shiatsu Customizable Massager 
MY RATING: 5/5 stars 
Yâ€™all. Itâ€™s going to be really hard to put into words how AMAZING this chair massager feels. Iâ€™ve been cooking Thanksgiving dinner for three days straight so this was a pleasure to sit down on afterward to relax. 
This comes all as one unit and you can strap it to a chair or sit it up straight on another straight surface (such as a couch). I really like to put it on my couch so I can have my legs out in front of me (and use a foot massager at the same time!). It also comes with a remote that is attached and is complete with a pocket directly on the chair for remote storage. 
I like the fact that this chair has multiple massage settings. You can do your full back, just your lower back, or your upper back. You can also have it massage your neck as well or leave can leave this function turned off. The chair also has a heat setting to help you relax even more. The seat will also vibrate to help soothe your thighs and lower back while the rest of the massage is happening. The remote also allows you to change the position of all the massage balls so you can hit just the right spot. ðŸ˜‰
