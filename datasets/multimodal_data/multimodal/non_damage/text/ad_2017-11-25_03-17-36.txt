Welcome to the holiday season my friends! And welcome to my home!❤️ I love decorating my front porch no matter what the season! We don’t get snow in the San Francisco Bay Area so I like to use poinsettias to make the porch festive! 🎄❤️🎄

How did you spend your first day of the season ....shopping or decorating? Or perhaps just recovering from your Thanksgiving feast? 😜🦃🙋How ever you spent your day I hope you got to enjoy time with friends and family! And maybe some turkey leftovers too! *
My beautiful holiday wreath is from @the.accidental.farmgirl Head to our Christmas shop on our blog to shop our favorite Christmas decor! Blessings for a joyful holiday, xoxo Jodie #thedesigntwins #ad
