Late Friday Night At The Bar w/ @vitruvian_physique 🍻.
_

Just wrapped up a Push Workout and it was all about the super sets. The gym is always empty on Friday nights so it makes it easy to do super sets or circuit workouts. I’m still on a mini cut with carb cycling for the next 1-2 weeks before I start a bulk. Have an awesome weekend guys💪🏾.
