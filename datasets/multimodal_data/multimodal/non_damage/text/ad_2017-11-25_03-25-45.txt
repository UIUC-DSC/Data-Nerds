In #Utah the #onion harvest has finished. The crop has nice size and is producing more jumbo onions but with yields down a little. Look for the market to follow the other western states. Quality is excellent and overall Utah has a very good harvest. Trucks that finish in Salt Lake City give Utah an advantage for transportation some other areas don’t have at the moment.⠀

#Colorado #onion size seems to vary greatly in Colorado. Yield also seems to vary. Quality looks good as they move forward with the harvest. Market price is stable.⠀
