Iâ€™m a sucker for a good blowout - especially one I can get at home. And I have been looking high and low for a styling tool that would give me lasting waves. Finally I've found the @Conair #3QDryer and #Conair2in1Styler. The dryer is gentle on my hair and the styler gives me waves for days (literally). More pics and full blog post on Mae Amor. #ad
