Woke up feeling that passionate energy! Why do you do what you do? I do what I do because I love to produce, I love to help others, I love to see others win, I want to build a life I don't need a vacation from, I want to create generational wealth, I want to honor God with my works! The list goes on but the moral of the story is if your "Why" isn't strong enough then when things get tough it's easy to quit. Anything done without passion and tenacity will not reach great levels. Put your heart in what you do and give it your "Best" everyday and I guarantee you will be happy with the results!
