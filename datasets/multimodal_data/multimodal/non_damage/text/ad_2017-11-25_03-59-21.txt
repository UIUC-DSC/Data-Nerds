Gideon Shiatsu Tapping Massage Chair 
MY RATING: 5/5 stars

I’m going to be honest for a second and say that I think I like this massage chair better than the first Gideon Shiatsu one I reviewed. This is definitely going to be my new favorite item, as it relieves so much stress and gets out the knots and cricks in your back extremely well. 
This massage chair is similar to the other in the fact that it also does a Shiatsu massage. The difference is that this massage chair “taps” as opposed to a rolling motion. Personally the tapping feeling feels better to me, but it boils down to each person’s preferences. You can increase or decrease the intensity of the taps as well as adjust the location. This massager also has a seat setting as well and feels great. There’s also a timed mode and it will automatically shut off after the time amount you chose is over. You can also choose the demo mode. 
The massager also comes with a car charger so you can use this on the go if you’re in the passenger seat. You can easily strap it to a car seat or a chair and massage anywhere! 
Overall this chair is super comfortable and greatly helps relieve stress and pain. If you’re a chronic illness sufferer like me, I HIGHLY recommend this item. Just don’t sit on it too long at a time as you can injure yourself if you’re a first time massager user.
