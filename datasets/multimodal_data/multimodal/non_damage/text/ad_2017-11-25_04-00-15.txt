I gotta say I was super excited to try this Gideon seat massager. When it arrived in the mail I opened it right away. Put it in my chair and got to work. I started playing around with all the buttons and the feature I love most is that this pad heats up from top to bottom! It vibrates in all areas of the pad and you can control exactly what you'd like massaged. It also has low to high intensity. What I would've like to have seen in this, is the massagers rotating. It's just sporadic vibrating. This pad has straps that slip over the back of your chair so it won't fall or slide down and it also came with an attachment cigarette charger so it could be plugged into your car. That's a plus to cold mornings since it has the option to heat. 147 Also a plus, a pocket to hold the remote so it doesn't get damaged.
*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
