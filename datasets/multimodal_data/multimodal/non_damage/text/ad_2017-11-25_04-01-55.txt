So far Ryker has really enjoyed camping out on the living room floor with Dan or I watching Pokemon in this HUGE sleeping bag since it came in the mail. It is the perfect size for snuggling. It measures 59”H and 87”H, fitting 2 people comfortably. It came packed inside a traveling sack. The sack makes it easy to carry or clip onto a book bag. The exterior lining is waterproof. The inside is lined with a fleece like material. Even though it is lightweight it still keeps you nice and warm, however it is a 3 season bag. I do not believe it would be warm enough for winter temperatures in NEPA. The sleeping bag comes with 2 pillows (smaller in size – 14”x 10”) and also has 2 interior pockets which are great for holding keys, phones, etc. There are zippers on both sides of the bag so either person is able unzip. There is also a variety of ways you can use this bag, either as a double sleeping bag, two single sleeping bags, or unzip and lay flat for 2 large blankets.
