Guess what… I’m moving out! But before I did, I wanted to preserve my room in a video via the @google Pixel 2 XL, which, if not for the camera’s incredible internal stabilization, high dynamic range and advanced SW denoising, would have been a very different video to watch (especially since Eric and I shot this video in pretty low lighting).
