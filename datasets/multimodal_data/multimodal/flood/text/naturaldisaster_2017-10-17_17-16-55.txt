@Regranned from @tvshowthebooth -  Much of Puerto Rico is still without power, water, phones, and internet several weeks after a major hurricane slammed into the island. DONATE at TIDAL.com/PuertoRico to give direct help to those in needs. Planes of aid are being sent to help those who are not being reached by FEMA. This is a serious crisis and electricity is not expected to be restored until December 15th. Some people are forced to drink potentially hazardous water. Find it in your heart to donate.
