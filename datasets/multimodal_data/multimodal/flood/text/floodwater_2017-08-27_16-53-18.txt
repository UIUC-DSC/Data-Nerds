Pray for us in Houston. My house, neighborhood, and entire area is completely under water. I was barely able to make it to my sisters house that's higher ground before everything went under but so many other people aren't so lucky. My heart breaks for my city. #hurricaneharvey #tropicalstorm #jurassicjeep #jurassicpark #jurassicworld #jeepsofinstagram #wrangler #texas #houston #flood #floodwater
