Another year, another flood. The second wave of floods that has hit Assam this year has taken the total deaths count to 150 as on Friday, August 18, and hit nearly 33 lakh people in 25 districts of the Stateâ€™s 32 districts, besides snapping rail connectivity to the Northeast India.  Of the 60 deaths in the second wave, 12 were reported from Morigaon, nine each in Kokrajhar and Dhubri and seven in Bongaigaon, reports TOI. The flood situation in the State remains critical with close to 1.39 lakh people taking shelter across 629 relief camps, according to reports by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDM). Swollen by heavy monsoon this year,  Brahmaputra river and some of its tributaries are flowing over the danger limits.
