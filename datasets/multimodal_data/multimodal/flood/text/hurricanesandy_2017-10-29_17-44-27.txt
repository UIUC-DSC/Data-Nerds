Hurricane Sandy’s powerful ocean waves devastated the town of Sea Bright, New Jersey. According to the 2015 New York City Panel on Climate Change Report, the approx. 12 in. of sea level rise in NYC since 1900 may have expanded Hurricane Sandy’s flood area by approx. 25 sq. miles, flooding the homes of more than 80,000 additional people in New York and New Jersey alone.
