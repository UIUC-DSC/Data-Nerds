@Regrann from @nytimes -  Yesterday, the photographer @alyssaschukar took this #aerial photo of #floodwater surrounding homes in Beaumont, Texas. Today, close to a week since a devastating hurricane made landfall in Texas, some residents of the region are embarking on the long path toward recovery while others are still very much in the midst of crisis. In #Beaumont, a city of almost 120,000 people near the Louisiana border, running water was cut off by flooding, and the situation is dire. Brad Penisson, a fire rescue captain in Beaumont, said today that the city was setting up water distribution stations, and that restoring drinking water had become its most urgent priority.
