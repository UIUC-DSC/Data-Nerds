Today the #bywater once again reduced to #floodwater... one of the many reasons I have made my home on #thenorthshore of #nola in a wet, but warm and #welldrained place. People down there #lol about days like today cuz it's become normal to them, that's cuz most are new and haven't yet had the experience of losing so much that posting on #Facebook about how "omg it's totally flooded today #haha!" Would NOT occur to the truly #tragedy-stricken. #socialmedia posts are not a priority for anyone who is truly #suffering.today is MILD, and too many talk like this shit is cute. I #LOVE #newOrleans, more than any city in #theunitedstates, but I love living a drivable distance from it. Ultimately, I don't like any city due to that whole #humanity #populationdensity #peopleallergy thing I have, plus I don't want to #kayak to the grocery store just cuz of #heavyrains. Yes #Louisiana itself is #sinking, but I feel comfortable for the duration at my current elevation. #waitingforskynet either way #comedy #comedian #stayfunny
