A year ago, my life completely changed. A disaster ruins homes, jobs, families. I was blessed with an amazing support system, and it actually brought me closer to those who surrounded me or depended on my time and efforts, even when I fell short. Thank you so much to everyone who has put up with my heartache this past year. You never want to lose what you have, but hopefully we'll find the beauty in the outcome. #hurricanematthew #morningafter #oneyearlater #whattheeff
