Incredible video from Air7HD over Acton this afternoon! Thunderstorms produced heavy rain just northwest of Acton. Estimated rain rates up to two inches per hour washed out roads, leaving cars trying to navigate rivers of mud. Cars continued trying to cross over the growing stream and avoid being washed away. Some cars were seen getting stuck in water at least 2-3 feet deep, and rescue teams were brought in. The backyards of some homes and fences were also overwhelmed by water.
