my eyes tear up when I see this pic, so much paintful that I could feel in her eyes, on her face, in her body parts which are covered by natural disaster. This photo was taken by Nguyễn Huy Khâm, and it was revealed on AI jazeera magazine. I have tried to not look at abundance of news on television, on the Internet as less as I can. But out of the die is cast, people share it on their Facebook, people talk about it more than gossips. And it is true, thanks for the one who is very braver than the fucking MONRE in my country, now the world is able to see how my people swimming in flood. Very appreciative and thankful.
