"An explosion sent flames raging in Ghana's capital, killing 150 people, hit a gas station crowded with residents seeking shelter from heavy rains". Our heart goes out to all our Ghana brothers and sisters in these Hard times. May the Souls of those who lost their lives Rest in Perfect Peace 😇😇😇🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿 God Bless Africa . #accrafloods #prayforghana #Africaunited #RIP #tunes4utk #T4utkghanateam
