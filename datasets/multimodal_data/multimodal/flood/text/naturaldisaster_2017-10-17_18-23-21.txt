Natural Disaster Update: A tropical depression and flooding has left 54 dead and 39 missing in Vietnam. 
A former construction professor at the University of Hanoi stated that if accurate rain volume had been forecasted, reservoirs would have released water earlier and more slowly, reducing the risk of floods in the lowlands. The poor forecast resulted in sudden water release which surprised residents. As a consequence, they did not have time to evacuate.
