We're standing with fellow residents who are stranded at #Prytania and #Delachaise during this morning's rainfall. We've seen disabled folks wading through #floodwater, folks taking off their shoes and carrying children, while #ambulances struggle to drive through up to 4 inches of standing water to get to the #Touro #emergencyroom. It's time for better solutions to address our #streetflooding.
