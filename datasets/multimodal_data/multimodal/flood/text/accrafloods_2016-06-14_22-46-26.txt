Children are the most curious people in the world. The most adventurous and I dare to say the most happy people when left to do their own things. The rains may bring distruction to some people but to these kids it was another fun day. May our curiosity not fade away with age. The joy of childhood is enviable. #hopesalive #rainyday #childhood  #kidspay #africanchild #Accrafloods #outdoor #Futureleaders #soccer #football #europa #afcon #playinggames #documentary #documentaryphotography #natgeocreative
