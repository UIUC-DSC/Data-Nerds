Hi my lovelies, check out My first hand experience of the #AccraFloods & fire on the blog www.theonlywayisghana.com or click link in bio.
I thank God that I live to tell the tale, after so many people just like me lost their lives. May their souls rest in peace ❤️😢🙏 #pray4accra #pray4ghana #picoftheday #prayforaccra #PrayingForAccra #PrayingForGhana #instabest #sadbuttrue #sadtimes #theonlywayisghana #the233way #onlyinghana #accrafloods #Africa #rainyseason #Ghana #ghanalife #supporteachother #sunshinewillcome #thankGod #blessed
