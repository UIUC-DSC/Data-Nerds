Here's a short video of what it looks like where we are. Luckily we are safe and the water didn't reach the house, but I was getting a little nervous when I woke up and saw this the other day and it continued raining. It was much deeper on the surrounding roads, but that has mostly drained down now. Hopefully our road starts draining soon! This was shot with my Phantom 4 Pro. The neighbors thought the drone was exciting. @djiglobal #HurricaneHarvey #Harvey #Texas #Hurricane #flood #flooded #floodwater #flooding #underwater #PearlandTexas #Pearland #TropicalStorm #TropicalStormHarvey
