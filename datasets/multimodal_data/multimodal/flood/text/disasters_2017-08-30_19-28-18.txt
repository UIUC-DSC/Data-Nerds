I've been hearing so many stories about the disasters & how strong the victims of #hurricaneharvey have been. It's so easy for us to desensitize and distance ourselves from something that doesn't directly effect us. I'm guilty too until, Yesterday hearing about a family of 4 who had their week old-new-born-baby concealed in a plastic tub with holes poked on top to keep it safe & out of all the water. That turned into something I could not only hear but now visualize. I've already made my donation and plan on doing all that can to help. If anyone else wants to help I encourage you to go here: https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation 
Houston we love you and are here in your support. Be strong. 🙏🏾 #tezmanic
