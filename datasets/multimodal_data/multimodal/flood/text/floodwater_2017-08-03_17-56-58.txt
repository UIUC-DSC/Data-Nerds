What a July we've had! The month started  with another flood which caused damage to the cabin and floated my Tipi, but did very minimal damage to our land or house! We dug in with help from our friends and repaired the cabin,  secured the Tipi  and got ready for our summer visitors. 35 family and friends have stayed with us this month already!! Pictures of all the festivities will be coming!!
