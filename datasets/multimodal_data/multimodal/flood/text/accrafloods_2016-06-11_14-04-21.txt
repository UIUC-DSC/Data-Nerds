It's rainy season here in Ghana. This is the gutter in Nima, filled and flooding. I watched the rain from my window over the course of an hour, the sewers and gutters on the sides of the street were stuffed due to a build up of trash. The water couldn't flow, and as a result the water and trash began to flow out into the street- forming a new river. Lots of people came out to watch, myself included. Last year, well over 150 people died in the flood because a Total gas station blew up. Because of last years tragic accidents, people were telling me that this wasnt as bad. I have never seen any flooding like this before, so I was in awe. Everyone else seemed rather calm, cars and motorcycles still drove over this bridge and everything! And the water did go down by night! ☔️☔️☔️#accra #ghana #accrafloods
