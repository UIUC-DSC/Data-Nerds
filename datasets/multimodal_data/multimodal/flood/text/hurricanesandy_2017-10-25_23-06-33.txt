Study 06 ex. A :: The Waterline :: Emulating the calm after the storm, the Waterline Mirror was designed as an homage to the resiliency of the Red Hook community in the aftermath of the superstorm. The water-saturated walls of buildings in the neighborhood bore this stain for months to come, reminding us all of the power of nature. As we approach the five year anniversary of Sandy, we honor the lessons we learned and the strength of our community. ⠀
