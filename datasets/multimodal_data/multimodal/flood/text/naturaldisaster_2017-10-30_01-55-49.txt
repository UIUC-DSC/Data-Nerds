It’s been 5 years since Hurricane Sandy rocked the north east. Even though this superstorm only made landfall as a Category 1, it is still the second costliest hurricane in US History. While I was stranded in my apartment for 3 days and out of a home for a month, I know people who didn’t have a home to return to. It was an eerie and strange time for New Yorkers - especially when ALL OF THE LIGHTS WENT OUT -> the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, all of lower Manhattan! But it was also one of those beautiful times when people were more kind to one another. Friends and even acquaintances who had power offered food and shelter (@jlw5002 @erinttaylor). Strangers were doing the same for other strangers.  While we made it through and moved on with our lives, it’s crazy to think that some folks and business are still recovering. That’s some crazy shit. Mother Nature is a powerful thing.
