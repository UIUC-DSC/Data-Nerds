Did I say yesterday, that I am going to enjoy the sun in Denmark? 🙈 Some pictures from our bike tour. I should better have brought my bikini... 😂
We were ending up somewhere in the middle of nowhere,  where all directions were flooded with water. After some discussions in the group, I got "the honour" to go first and find a way out. It pays off to be that kind of friend where everyone trusts in your fitness, and knows you can swim out in worst case! 🤣
In the end, we found a way where the water level was not as deep so we could pass through. ☺ The film is from a street where we couldn't continue because the water got too deep further on. 
All in all, i felt that our trip yesterday was a little bit inspired from this year's crossfit games - carrying our bikes, driving through flood water and riding on some adventurous trails. 🏊‍♂️ 🚴‍♀️ ☺
