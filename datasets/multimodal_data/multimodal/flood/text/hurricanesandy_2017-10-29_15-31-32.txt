*long post alert * 5 years ago Hurricane Sandy took my home & every single material posession I had. 
We were homeless for 5 months, & I learned some of the most important lessons of my life in that time. Here's a few:
- Humanity isn't completely lost. We had nothing, but friends and strangers came together and offered whatever they could to help. (PLEASE give to an organization you trust to help Puerto Rico and the other islands affected by Hurricanes this summer) - With everyone in my neighborhood filled with loss, and depression, I learned how important my gift to produce smiles and laughter is. - Uncertainty is scary,  struggle is discouraging, but it gets better if you appreciate each new day & have the faith & Courage to keep moving forward towards your goals. 
5 years later,  I'm the best version of myself that I've been thus far! Good health,  Good job,  GOOD HAIR ðŸ˜Ž LOL,  still performing, & so much food in the fridge I write songs about it! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I've always believed we help others through sharing our personal experiences.  So if anybody is going through any type of struggle,  I hope this helps! Keep your head up,  Keep laughing, Keep the faith & Keep moving forward!
