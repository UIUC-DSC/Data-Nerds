No, this unfortunately wasn't a river. This was the aftermath of hurricane Irma in my community. It has been two months since the hit to our area and today I want to bring attention to and give thanks to everyone who has helped clean up and rebuild. Individuals have come together in helping each other. Companies have worked around the clock to get life back to normalcy. Various missions groups and churches have banned together to support families who have lost much. I wish I could name them all so they could get the thanks they deserve, but it is a good thing when there have been so many that it is impossible to cover them all.
