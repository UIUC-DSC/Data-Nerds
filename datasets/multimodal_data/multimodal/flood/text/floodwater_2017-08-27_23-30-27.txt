Honestly SHOCKED at the devastation this wonderful city is experiencing- I don't think anyone really thought it would be this bad 😞 In case of emergency please call the #coastguard at 281-464-4855 as #911 may not be able to respond to everyone #Houston #houstonflood #houstonflooding #harvey #hurricaneharvey #prayforhouston 🙏🏼 {We are safe at the moment in #Katy but the rain just started hard again so we shall see}
