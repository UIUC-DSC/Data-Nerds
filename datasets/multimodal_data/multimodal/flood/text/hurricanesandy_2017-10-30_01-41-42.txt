(2012)  Five years ago this week, the Jersey Shore was devastated by Hurricane Sandy.  The destruction was like nothing I had ever seen in my lifetime. As people are still continuing to rebuild, New Jersey residents are stronger than ever. Some houses were blown right off their foundations, while houses directly next-door stood almost perfectly throughout the storm. The Atlantic Ocean broke right through the Beach/streets and merged with the bay. (See pix). The flooding was simply unimaginable.  My family and I were very lucky to have had only minor property damage. My heart still goes out to those who lost so much. 🙏🏻💗 #sandy #hurricanesandy #devastation
