It's rainy here in New York today- nothing like the crazy winds and storm surges of 5 years ago during Sandy but does put one in the state of mind to check out the multimedia story we did several days after Sandy
・・・
Superstorm Sandy hit New York 5 years ago and the storm surge flooded Red Hook, devastating and impacting many. Click on the link in my bio to watch a short multimedia story about several artists in Red Hook affected by Sandy.  Z Behl, with Benh Zeitlin, and Dustin Yellin of Pioneer Works share their experiences. @zbehl @pioneerworks @dustinyellin @giantsfan2929 #superstormsandy #hurricanesandy #redhook #brooklyn #fiveyearanniversary #fiveyearson #beastsofthesouthernwild
