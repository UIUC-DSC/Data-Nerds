Flashback to this time last year, when the Murray River was in flood, the largest flood in many decades. We'd had so much rain. This picture was taken from a helicopter we had to use to get to our house - once there we were unable to go anywhere until the floodwaters had receded enough to get our tractors through.  We were temporarily living on a little island with a paddock in each direction that was just above the water level!  Fast forward to October, 2017, and we desperately need rain. A good solid soaking. Our rainfall for the year to date is way below the average.  #murrayriver #nsw #riverina #farmlife #countrylife #floodwater #murrayfloods2016 #country_features #renegade_rural #moodynature #trb_rural #pocket_farms #photography
