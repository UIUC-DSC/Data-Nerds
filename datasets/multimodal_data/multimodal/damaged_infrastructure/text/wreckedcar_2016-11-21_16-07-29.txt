This is what drink driving looks like... The driver of this car was intoxicated, speeding and not wearing a seat belt. He hit the back of my brother in laws car as he was preparing to turn into the driveway. The car has mounted the footpath in front of my sisters house, hit a tree and he has then fled on foot, leaving the scene. Thankfully my brother in law is okay. A massive shock for my sister and the family of the driver who caused the accident as the car wasn't his and they aren't insured.. my guess is he will be feeling it when the alcohol wears off.. #dontdrinkanddrive #staysafe #wearaseatbelt #caraccidents #everyonesok #shocked #wrecked #wreckedcar #police #ambulance #towed
