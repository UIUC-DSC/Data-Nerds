Iran-Iraq Earthquake Kills More Than 450.
The Iranian city of Pol-e Zahab was particularly hard hit by the earthquake that struck on Sunday near the Iraqi border. At least 445 people were killed and 7,370 people were injured in Iran, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which gave an estimate significantly higher than the death toll of 407 that officials had announced earlier.
Pray for the victims.
