Two lady's in their 70's were rescued from a car that careened out into the front of a house at Carlingford yesterday. Severe structural damage was done to the house and the threat of full collapse was a huge concern to rescuers. After initial stabilisation was established the casualties were extracted from the vehicle by specialist rescue firefighters from FRNSW. Doctors and Paramedics from NSW Ambulance and Careflight stabilised the ladies prior to their removal. #carlingford #FRNSW #firefighters #collapse #carvhouse #severedamage #USAR #urbansearchandrescue #nswambulance #paramedic #careflight #doctors #ems #firstonscenephotos #nswpolice #police #stabilisation #acrowprops #buildingcollapse #photojournalism #photojournalist #canonaustralia #100400mm #canon5dmarkiii #canoncollective #chiefmiller
