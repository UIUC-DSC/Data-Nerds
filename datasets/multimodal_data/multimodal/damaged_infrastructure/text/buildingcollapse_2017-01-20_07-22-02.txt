The trial of two engineers indicted for the September 2014 Synagogue church building collapse was on Thursday adjourned to a date in February due to the absence of a prosecution witness said to be overseas.

The engineers, Akinbela Fatiregun and Oladele Ogundeji were in charge of building the collapsed Synagogue Church guest house that led to the death of over 100 worshippers, majority of them South Africans.

They are are being prosecuted by the Lagos state government before Justice Lateef Lawal-Akapo of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja.
