These heartbreaking images are from what's going on in Iran and Iraq these days.
Earthquake happened and changed everything they've gotten.
Please pray for those fathers who lost their babies.
Pray for children that lost their siblings.
Pray for people, they lost everything 😢

بنويسيد زنی مُرد كه زنبيل نداشت
پسری زير زمين بود و پدر بيل نداشت
بنويسيد كه با عطر وضو آوردند
نعش دلدار مرا لای پتــو آوردند
زلفها گرچه پر از خاک و لبش گرچه كبود
"دوش می‌آمد و رخساره بر افروخته بود
😢😢😢💔💔💔
