You don't see as many huge areas of vacant land but collapse, abandonment are not foreign sights in #southstl. It's just not at the scale as #northstl. It is almost like 2 different cities. Maybe brick thieves as in just the rear is like this. The front looks fine and has a sale sign. This is one I sketched. As an artist it's a challenge and whether it's good or not, they are fun to draw cause there is so much happening. Notice that dangling chunk of brick near the roof. #Stl #stlouis #marinevilla #hurthouseportrait #stlhouse #stlarchitecture #architecture #abandoned #vacant #buildingcollapse #collapse #ruins #stlruins
