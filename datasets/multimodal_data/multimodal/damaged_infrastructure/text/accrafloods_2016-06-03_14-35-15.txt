@Regrann from @yemmeybaba -  Exactly a year today [June 3rd 2015 - Chuks, Olu, Zion & GrandPa were driving through that route until we suddenly had a rethink to pass through 37 instead of Circle, hmmm]....Have we learnt our lessons as a nation? 
RIP to the gone souls. #AccraFloods #June3rd #MemorialDay #Regrann
