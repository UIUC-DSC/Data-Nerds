//DISASTER RELIEF//
🆘🆘🆘
.
MAF is working in support of our partner @samaritanspurse In the Caribbean so that those in need can be reached sooner and more efficiently.
.
Our aircraft can be airborne within hours of a disaster – helping build a picture of the devastation and need from the air. MAF can assist in the aftermath ferrying essential supplies of tarpaulins, food, water and medical supplies and bringing in teams of workers to areas where roads and bridges have been washed away – as they were in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.
.
Since 1945 MAF has enabled the work of churches, relief organisations, missionaries, medical teams, development agencies, and others working to share God’s love and make life better for those who live in the most isolated parts of the world. In recent years, MAF has responded to disasters in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew, in Nepal following two deadly earthquakes in 2015, and in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.
