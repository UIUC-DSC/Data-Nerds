Yesterday, I got into the worst car accident of my life in St. Petersburg, FL. Amidst all my errors, including driving citations I didn't hurt myself, nor the other driver, and I'm doing fine... Just frazzled. Between the pouring rain all day, breaking traffic surprised me, and as I went for my brakes, they gave out and my car completely locked up at 35MPH. Hydroplaning, I crashed. It was certainly a symbolic and chaotic end to driving for a while. Turns out I had a suspended license, without my knowledge, because of a few stupid mistakes I never took care of in terms of toll bills and timing. Moral of the story is: God gave me another chance to live again, to do things right and the junkyard took my car for $375, enough to break even from my tickets. For now, life is going to be tough and tricky, but the light will shine through like it always does, when the rain stops pouring down. â˜” ðŸš— Goodbye, old friend. Count your blessings and stay on top of your driving situations. Don't fall behind on payments, always check your driving status. Be safe out there, the world needs YOU today...AND tomorrow, too. #CarAccident #LuckyToBeAlive #pouringrain #godisgood #secondchances #wreckedcar #countyourblessings #doingthingsrightthistime
