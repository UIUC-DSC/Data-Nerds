Praying for Dhaka in Bangladesh right now. When something devastating like this happens so close to home it puts life into perspective. Over 250 people dead and so many more still to find, Cant believe the pictures! My love and thoughts go out to my Desh and to everyone affected. #PrayingForDhaka #Bangladesh #BuildingCollapse #Tragic #Unbelievable #Home
