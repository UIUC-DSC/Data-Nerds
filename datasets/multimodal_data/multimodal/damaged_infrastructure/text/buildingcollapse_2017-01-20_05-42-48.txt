The Packed Product Storage at @snakeriverproduce collapsed this afternoon. No employees were injured - for which we are so very grateful! Our facilities will be closed Friday and Saturday. We hope to be packing product again Monday. Stay safe out there! #snakeriverproduce #srponions #buildingcollapse #winter2017 #easternoregon #nyssaoregon
