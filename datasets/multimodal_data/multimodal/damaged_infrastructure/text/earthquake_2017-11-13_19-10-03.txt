To hear people, especially Christians, say that people in Iran and Iraq are receiving the consequences of their actions from the earthquake that has killed 320+ people and injured 5,000+ is disgusting and disappointing. EACH person is an image bearer of God, which means they have value. They are His children and Christ died for them, just as He died for you, no matter your gender, color of your skin, or religion. 
Praying fervently for those in Iran and Iraq who are injured, who are missing, those who have been traumatized, and the families who have lost loved ones. May the Prince of Peace pour out His shalom onto them.
