On This Day in 1983

Beirut bombings

Suicide bombers detonate two truck bombs outside the barracks housing the US 1st Battalion 8th Marines in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 servicemen and injuring more than 100. Almost simultaneously, another suicide attack on France's military barracks takes the lives of 58 paratroopers. #onthisday #beirut #suicidebombing #lebanon #usmarines #frenchmitary
