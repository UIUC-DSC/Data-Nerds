As we are hearing the sad news of the #earthquake in Iraq and #Iran and how the numbers of those lost and affected have increased over night... please take a moment to make a special pray/dua for those in need, not just those in #Iraq, but those in #Myanmar, #Bangladesh, #Texas, #Ethiopia, and everyone around the world.
