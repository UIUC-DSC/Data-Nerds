So five years ago to this day 10/29/2012, NYC was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Ironic that today we are dealing with a very nasty storm though not nearly as destructive. It’s raining like crazy and we’re due for some strong wind gusts later on. Back in 2012 I remember spending a sleepless night closely watching 3 trees that I really thought were going to come down on my house. They didn’t but it was a close call. Once the storm passed I walked the neighborhood and was stunned by how many trees did come down. The one pictured was the biggest I had seen. Amazingly I think I only saw one tree down in all of #AstoriaPark #hurricanesandy #superstormsandy #hurricane #Astoria #astoryofastoria #boromagazine @boromagazine
