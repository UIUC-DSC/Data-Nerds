Imagine you're hiking through a nice green valley and suddenly you find one wrecked Citroen after another.

This one was the most intact and probably just got rolled down the hill, when the owner didn't want it anymore.

The other car wrecks looked more like they've just gotten thrown off a cliff and tumbled the way down here. You barely could recognize which model it was.

Well, I suppose that's how you got rid of your car in the 60â€™s. :D
