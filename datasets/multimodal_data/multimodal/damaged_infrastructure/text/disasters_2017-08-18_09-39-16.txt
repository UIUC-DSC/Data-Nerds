Those being killed for the religious beliefs, those who are still Enslaved (KOREA ----#MamaAfrica.. ) my #Blackpeople that don't #love themselves enough to stop  bleaching and killing their own.. Ye I will forever keep saying it.. the sick in mind and body, physically,mentally, and Spiritually ( I count myself in) the poor, Lord those who don't have the basic necessities of life! 😓 The broken hearted, the ones contemplating: murder, rape, suicide, abuse, WAR .. voodoo.. list goes on..
