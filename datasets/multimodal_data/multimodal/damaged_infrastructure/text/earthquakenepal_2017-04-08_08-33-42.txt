Since just giving the blankets, eventhough it was a big help, didn't feel enough Atle decided to rebuild the school in the mountain village, Mukli. Today there is also another school, in Randapu, founded by him. Children without a school will loose their faith and ULLPLEDDs mission is to give education and hope to the kids of Mukli and Randapu! 🏠📚 #education #ullpleddnepal #reconstruction #earthquakenepal #solukhumbudistrict #school
