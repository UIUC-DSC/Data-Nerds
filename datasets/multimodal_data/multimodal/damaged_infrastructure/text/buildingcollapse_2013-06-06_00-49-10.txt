That's my #priusc that totally saved me and the boys today. We were driving by when the #buildingscollapsed right next to us. Two bricks hit the windshield and there are some minor dents and scratches, but we walked and drove away. Thinking of those injured and killed and thankful for the first responders who were there very fast. #philly #philadelphia #feelinglucky
