Here's some video of the smoldering ruins in White Hall, IL. When I left I smelled like a campfire. 3 massive buildings destroyed by a giant fire. A local woman told me about it all. Just unbelievably sad. So much history and such a historic loss in a really small town. #smalltownusa #whitehall #centralillinois #illinois_shots #architecture #brickstagram #firedamage #buildingruins #exploreillinois #buildingfire
