It's hard to believe, but it has already been a month since Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas. For many, clean up continues even after 30 days and we continue to respond as quickly, efficiently and professionally as possible. Until our City is ALL back on its feet we will work tirelessly in this effort. #houstonstrong #servprogalveston #servpro #houston #houstonbusiness #houstonproperties #hurricane #residential #restoration #restorationhouston #residentialrestoration #flood #waterdamage #waterrestoration #harvey #harveyrelief #rebuildinghouston #flood #floodwater
