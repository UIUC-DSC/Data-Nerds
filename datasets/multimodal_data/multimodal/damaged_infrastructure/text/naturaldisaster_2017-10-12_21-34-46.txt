I feel totally helpless. A community that I lived in for most of my life is burning and I can't do anything about it. I know people that are displaced, have lost their homes, and their animals. My recommendation for anybody that wants to help, is to donate to local causes and not big corporations like the Red Cross. Redwood Credit Union is local and has started a fund and has said that they will cover all of administrative costs so that the money will go straight to victims of the fire. www.redwoodcu.org
