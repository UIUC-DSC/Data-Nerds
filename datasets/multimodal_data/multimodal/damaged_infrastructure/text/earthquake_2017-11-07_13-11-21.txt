@Regrann from @karriem_muhammad -  #DisasterPreparedness: #Christ warns us that a Major #Earthquake will soon Destroy Many Cities in America.

So we Must Prepare. We must store some food and water in our homes. 2-3 weeks to 2-3 months worth. And ways to cook and clean. First aid supplies.

Why?

Because after this Major Earthquake nearly every street, nearly every road, highway, will be destroyed.

No food coming in or out. No HELP coming to us. 
And all that we have in our homes is all that we will have. What if it takes three weeks to get the road fixed to get food into your city. Could you survive for three weeks with what you currently have in your home? 
How much water do you have stored? After this earthquake we won't be able to just turn on the water. There will be no water coming out because all the pipes, all the water mains will be destroyed. 
To learn how to prepare. To learn how much food and water we need, how to store it, and the best foods to store, send me an email at writermdm@gmail.com and I'll send you an disaster preparedness manual. - #regrann
