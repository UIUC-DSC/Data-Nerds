RAVAGES OF WAR. Today with a day off, we headed to #Hiroshima & the site of the first atomic bomb dropped. A haunting & sad site, since so many innocent people were killed. It is essential governments, all governments, understand the magnitude of pain, war causes! #world #peace #pain #destruction #war #humanity #visiting #japan #sad #dayoff #jewelrydesigner #instagood #hiroshimapeacememorialpark #crazy #life #diplomacy #history #death
