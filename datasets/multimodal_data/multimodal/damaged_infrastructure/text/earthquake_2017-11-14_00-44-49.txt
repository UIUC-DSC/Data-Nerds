The earthquake that rocked Puebla, Mexico (which borders Morelos) on September 19th is roughly 80 miles away from Jojutla, my husbands hometown.  Jojutla is the town that was struck the hardest and sustained the most damage. 90% of the town is in rubble or has to be torn down. The devastation is shocking and eye opening of the power of Mother Earth. The spirits of the people are high and it seems that it has brought everyone together. I’ve only been here a few times, but it will never be the same. My favorite places for a morning latte or pastor tacos have been wiped out. It’s encouraging to see the amount of construction going on around the town and I look forward to seeing the rebuild. No words can express how extremely thankful we are that the whole family is safe and sound and only sustained minor damage. 
This will be a working vacation but I am excited to be able to help anyway I can. Our first day was replacing a toilet. We will be replacing a wall and hauling out as much rubble as possible. 
My heart bleeds for those that lost everything and those that are not able to rebuild.  Fingers crossed that aid is on the way.
