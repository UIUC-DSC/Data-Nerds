5 years ago this was my street where I lived... Hurricane Sandy came in with a vengeance and she changed my life forever. At 30 years old I had to start over again... I have wonderful friends and family that didn't let me do it alone. Their generosity was humbling. Sandy led me on a path to success. I am happily relocated in a wonderful area that has been good to me, I have built up a successful training career and I have made new friends for a lifetime. It wasn't easy, but for me it happened for a reason. My heart goes out to Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida...you will rebuild and you will be stronger than ever. Stuff comes and goes, we suffer from attachments. On this anniversary, let's celebrate our strength. Positive situations come from the negative. We persevere and keep moving forward! #hurricanesandy #2012 #ortleybeach #fielderave #humble #pride #friends #family #jerseystrong #sandyanniversary #5yearanniversary #onward #upward #helpeachother #loveeachother #bekind #charity #donate #helpinghands #rebuild #strongerthanever #puertorico #texas #florida
