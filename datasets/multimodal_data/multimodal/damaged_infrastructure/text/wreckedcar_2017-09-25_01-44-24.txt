Definitely want forget this trip to Louisiana. We are all okay. This was caused by a reckless driver that was ahead of us. He was weaving in and out of traffic, caused a car to lock brakes end up side ways on a two lane interstate with people traveling 80 MPH. Cars locked brakes, but Tonya couldn't stop fast enough. #wrecklessdrivers#wreckedcar#baddriver#pissedoff#wrecklessdriver#don'tneedtodrive
