From the displaced persons camp, we headed to our second stop of the day: an MSF-supported health centre. We set up a makeshift emergency room for people with paediatric and maternity complications. We've also had to rent minibuses to act as ambulances. Before, if people couldn't find someone willing to drive their loved ones to a hospital they would often have to go without medical care. 
It's dangerous being on the roads in Yemen, getting stuck behind cars makes everyone in the team worried as airstrikes can happen at any time. Thankfully, traffic wasn't bad today and we made it through OK, but the person driving this truck delivering apples wasn't as fortunate.
