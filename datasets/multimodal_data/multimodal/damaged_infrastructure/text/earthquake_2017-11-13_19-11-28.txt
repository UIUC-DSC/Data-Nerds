I woke up with all this feelings and emotions, visions and reflections.... I had a dream someone told me "there is earthquakes, and more coming and you are sleeping! " I woke up to the news and for my surprise #iran and #costarica had earthquakes. My prayers go out to all those ppl and the previous countries, love and prayers for only they know they pain and struggle they're experiencing.... we don know when we next, all those we know is coming. Don't take life for granted be thankful for what you got and tell the ones you love how much you loved them! You never know when is the last time you will see them. Remember there is other people all over the world going through worst struggles and pain. Mean while you're alive you have the power to change things and I mean anything or everything , being in the dark and walking through darkness, that is a daily struggle to reach to the light! Honor you light! For that is the fountain of love! Love and blessing to all of you ‚ù§Ô∏èüåé #myprayerstotheworld #mothernatureisspeaking #prayerstoiran #prayerstomexico #prayerstocostarica #prayerstoall #love #earthquake #pray #lovetheppl #myprayersarewithyou #earthquakes #soundofsilence #dreams #carastrophic #pain #loss #weareallonefamily #bloodofthegods
