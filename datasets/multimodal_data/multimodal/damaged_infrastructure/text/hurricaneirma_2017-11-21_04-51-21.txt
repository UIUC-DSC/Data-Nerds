Here's a look at the damage a hurricane can cause. This strong bridge in the Everglades was completely snapped in half and thrown into the water.

I planned my trip to south Florida much before Hurricane Irma, but these pictures remind me to not forget. Media cycles move quick and it's easy to take in these disasters as the drama of the week. But many people call places that the hurricane hit home. And that home may not be restored months after even though the news has moved on. Know all of you affected by hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters remain in my prayers. ❤️🙏🏽
