#NewYork has the power to counter a record greenhouse #gas surge!

Amidst all the mind-bending news of the week #terrorattack on a #Manhattan bike path; chair of a presidential campaign indicted for “conspiracy against the =UnitedStates” — one other story stands out for its long-term importance: researchers reported that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere surged by a record amount last year.

CO2 levels rose by 3.3 parts per million in the air, 50% faster than the average over the last decade. That means a few things, none of them good.

First, the last time there was this much carbon #dioxide in the atmosphere roughly three to five million years ago  the extra heat it trapped made #Earth a very different place. Among other things, sea levels rose as much as 20 meters.

Note that #TimesSquare is about 16 meters above sea level!

Second, this rise is coming much faster than anything in previous history. We're burning coal and oil and #gas much faster than #volcanoes have ever produced #CarbonDioxide before 10 to 20 times as fast.

Third, this year’s sudden spike may be a sign that the planet’s forest and ocean systems — which slowly absorb carbon from the atmosphere — may be beginning to falter. We know that forests and grasslands are stressed by the extra heat and dryness — the cloud of carbon pouring out of Napa and Sonoma in California last month’s fires is testimony to that.
