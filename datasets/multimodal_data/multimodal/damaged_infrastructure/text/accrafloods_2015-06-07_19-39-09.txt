From our partners at Ghana Flood Relief 2015. Our eyes and ears on the ground: "It was quite over whelming today with the stench of death, petrol, burnt items...people have lost everything, only thing they have left is hope." Please donate now to help rebuild lives. Ghana needs you. Link in the bio. #assistghana #AccraFloods #ghanafloodrelief2015 #prayforghana
