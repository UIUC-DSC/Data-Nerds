I read an article this weekend about Hurricane Sandy.  Apparently, it formed 5 years ago today.  Not really an anniversary I want to remember.  Living in Hoboken at the time, we got it pretty bad, but luckily our apartment was on the 5th floor.  I'll never forget wading through waist deep slop, a mix of Hudson River water, sewage and oil.  The whole town smelled like someone knocked over a porta-potty at low tide.  I remember eventually walking around to survey the damage and finding this boat up on the sidewalk, with a fairly apropos message scrawled on it.  That boat ended up staying on the sidewalk for weeks, maybe even months. It became something of a landmark and a reminder that our planet is pissed.  The silver lining of that storm was that it brought the good out in folks and brought them together.  I never saw a city unite and offer a helping hand like that before and maybe never will.  It certainly changed the tone of life in this area for pretty much every person who lived there.  I, for one, will always steer clear of living within flood range of any body of water because of that bitch named Sandy.  #newjersey #jersey #jerseystrong #hoboken #hurricanesandy #globalwarming #storm #travel #boat #travelstagram #weather #picoftheday
