This was the collapse ate of the Synagogue Church of All Nations which collapsed in 2014.
116 people died among which are 85 South Africans. The church said it was caused by a plane which flew over the building at just that moment.
But the inquest which was instituted by the Lagos state government indicted the Founder of the church T.B. Joshua and the engineers of the building.
But nothing has come.out of that indictment till date.
