Reminded (by fellow east coaster @xmikox516) that five years ago today, Hurricane Sandy hit NJ. Seeing the damage done, particularly at the shore, was a real eye-opener of the tragedy of natural disasters. I took these photos at Point Pleasant. The stormâ€™s destruction there was both sobering and amazing. (By the way, this is the type of damage that some senators actually voted against providing aid for at the time.) | Nov. 2012
