Again! #Earthquake with magnitude of 7.3 happened just few hours ago. Up to now 120 #people #died and more than 1000 were seriously injured. The earthquake hit the region of #Iran and #Iraq and was noticeable in #Turkey as well.

In an event like this, while #organizations starting research how they can help and how they get aid into the #disaster area; our cargo aircraft will be loaded with 50-100 tons of #emergency #aid from our warehouse and get ready for take off within 2-3 hours. 4 hours later, the aircraft is able to land direct in the affected area. Transporting #Medicine, #Water, #Shelter, Warming #Blankets, #Food... and #Rescue Teams! 
Crazy! just 90min ago, next earthquake hit #Costa #Rica with 6.5 magnitude! 
Only 7 hours between the earthquake in Iraq/Iran and the one in Costa Rica. 
What would we do in a situation like this if two #catastrophes happen at the same day?
No worries; we have a second #cargo #aircraft and a second flight crew stand by! It will fly to our partners warehouse in #Germany first, pick up the emergency aid and fly to Costa Rica after, where the aircraft will land 16 hours later.
