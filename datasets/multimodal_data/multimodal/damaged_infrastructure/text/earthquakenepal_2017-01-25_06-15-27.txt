After the earthquake in 2015, Kathmandu, Nepal has been left in ruins many places. People made homeless and the economy turned on its head. These unfortunate facts are such a big reminder why the Nepali people are so kind. I missed the warm welcome I got last year in Nepal. My dear friend has once again opened his home to me, providing food and shelter. I feel so lucky to have met this beautiful human being. It's unimaginable that such a beautiful people has been left so unfortunate in terms of the environment and politics. 25.01.17 #kathmandu #nepal #nepali #photography #southasia #earthquakenepal #tibet #pollution #river
