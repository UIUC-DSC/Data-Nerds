(10 photos here) 5 years ago "Frankenstorm" Sandy hit us. These are some of my shots from either the day after we emerged from our house and the following days after. I had just gotten back from Turcs and Caicos which Sandy hit us down there while we were on vacation. Then we flew over the outer bands and landed in Newark, 2nd to last plane in. The next day all hell broke lose. #jshn @jshn #photojournalism #photojournalist #hurricanesandy #jerseyshore
