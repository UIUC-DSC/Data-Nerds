FFPG TIPS:
This Video demonstrates the importance of collapse zones.
Even though this is not a fire scene it is a great example of what a collapsing wall can look like and how far the building material can go. Use this video for trainings on establishing collapse zones!
Collapse Zones should be 1 1/2 or 2 times the height of the building.
