Here, a woman in Les Cayes, Haiti, stands among trees ravaged by the 2016 hurricane.
Last November, I photographed the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew in Haiti for the August issue of National Geographic. There, the combination of poor sanitation with a natural disaster caused the remnants of cholera to surge. (Cholera was brought to Haiti by UN peacekeepers after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.) #haiti #hurricanematthew #sanitation @noorimages
