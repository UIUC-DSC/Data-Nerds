Kakeshwar Temple, one of the temples struck by the earthquake in Kathmandu. I passed by the unmanned entrance ticket booth and walked through the main walkway, witch once was neatly kept. And now it seems to attract a different kind of life here. The pile of bricks taken over by the pigeons I suspect are some of the remains from the last year's disaster.
