Last year these days we experienced a strong earthquake here in Wellington. Although it hit north of south island, we experienced a long strong shake here in the south of north island... just before midnight. I was new in Wellington and alone. There are no words to explain how scared I was. I stayed awake till morning, listening to the radio which was saying there was tsunami alert for Wellington. It was a very bad night following with a few bad days... that night I expected any thing... nothing happened to the flat that I was living in and no one died in wellington... you know in New Zealand they tell you to stay indoors when a shake occurs simply because of this fact: building are safe here...

Last night, there was a strong quake in Iran and... that is Iran... building are not safe and you are told that you should not stay inside if a quake happens... you should run outside... run for your life... in Iran earthquakes kill and it is not God's rage or whatsoever! It is people's fault! It is poor management fault...

 Luckily my family and friends are safe, but lots of my countrymen are not... some have lost their beloved ones... some have lost their houses... and some are still under debris... please pray for them... this is the least we can do...
