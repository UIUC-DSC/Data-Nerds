A little throw back to remember for the rest of my life.. just bought this car brand new took it off @toyotausa showroom floor had only 586 miles on it. Driving home and fell asleep behind the wheel, smacked a tree on the driver side and plummeted down the canyon... I woke up at 3 am with my car engulfed into flames. I was pinned and being that the FR-S is a tiny car I manage to crawl through the window on the passenger side.. months later and lot of support from my family and friends I was back on the streets. Thanks Toyota for building a great car that saved my life.. #scion #scionfrs #gt86 #gt86rocketbunny #wreckedcar #wrecked #wreckedexotics #flames #doomed #survived
