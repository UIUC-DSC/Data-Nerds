Life carrying on amidst the rubble in Kathmandu Durbar Square
September 2015 
Two years ago today at 11:56 Nepal time a 7.8 Magnitude earthquake occured in Gorkha which killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000. It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepalâ€“Bihar earthquake.The ground motion recorded in Kathmandu valley was of low frequency which, along with its occurrence at an hour where many people in rural areas were working outdoors, decreased the loss of property and human life. Nevertheless, the earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 21 making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.

Hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened, across many districts of the country. 
I was privileged to visit Nepal in September and see first hand the amazing emergency relief and long term development  work being done by Act Alliance Partners including Christian Aid and the United Mission to Nepal. 
Your support for this work is of massive impact to the lives of so many people and the recovery work continues.
