Five years ago today, I, along with all of the Patch editors on LI and in the metro NY area, was covering Hurricane Sandy as it walloped many of our communities, including mine: Lindenhurst, LI, NY.

I stayed online till the power went out in my house at 6P as the category 1 hurricane - later dubbed a superstorm - finally made landfall. The storm surge rocked my hometown, but you couldn't really assess the damage - which would take months and years to clean up - till the next day.

This photo of a house knocked off its foundation by the storm surge is one I took of one of the many homes devastated by Sandy when I toured the Village with the mayor and the emergency manager the next day. I posted my photo gallery that night. This home is no longer there.

That was just the start of the 5-year-long saga for many friends, family, neighbors and residents in Lindenhurst, and all along the south shore of LI, and all along every shoreline in the tri-state area. The saga, for many in Lindenhurst and LI and the tri-state area, sadly continues today. And the storm today underscores it all.

I will always be proud of the work I and my fellow Patch editors did before, during and after Sandy. I just wish our work could've prevented the devastation or got everyone back to pre-Sandy normal.
