My heart is so broken by this. All my thoughts and wishes goes out to the people of Somalia and Mogadishu and everyone who is affected by this horrific attack! More than 500 people directly hurt or killed and so many more hurt emotionally. I am so sad that this is our world and i am so sad of the lack of media coverage and empathy from the "western world". Somalia toosoo ‚úäüèº Stay safe and my condolences to everyone who has lost someone. #somalia #mogadishu #terrorattack
