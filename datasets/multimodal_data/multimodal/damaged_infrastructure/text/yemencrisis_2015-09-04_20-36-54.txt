Often I sleep in the hospital office we have just visited, but we had to make it Saada today to visit another health centre tomorrow. We arrived in Saada city around 6pm. The destruction is huge but people are still out on the streets. The generator we brought with us has broken already, but the driver has found bread so we eat dinner together by torchlight.
