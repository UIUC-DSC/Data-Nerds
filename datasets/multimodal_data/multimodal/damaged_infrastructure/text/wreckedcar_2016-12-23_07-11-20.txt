Recently, it was really windy in my city. It was windy for,like, at least a few days. One night, I was sound asleep until I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of a car horn. I don't how long it was going off, but it was starting to get monotonous and loud. I didn't know what happened, until the later in the morning; a tree branch fell right on top of the car (it wasn't property of my family) and broke the front window and one of the side ones! Thank God nobody was in there; I just hope that person is doing fine! #story #wreckedcar #ohmy #sad #windycity
