On my 200th post, I wish to share something different. Thats  my unforgettable experience with the worst hurricane in southern hemisphere. This mammoth category 5 cyclone with over 300km/hr gusts, not only destroyed infrastructure but took away lives and devastation was unlike anything I have seen. This entire experience personally was terrying but you do come out of it stronger💪.
Several months after the hurricane, I had the privilege to visit Nadarivatu for a dental program. I found that school children were still studying without electricity and learning in cramped classrooms due to the extensive devastation. It was difficult for aid to reach this location, therefore rebuilding phase was slow. Yet they hardly complained. Actually, they were more afraid of the dentist😐. It was estimated about 120,000 children been affected according to the UN.
Aftermath of the hurricane was a real struggle but thanks to foreign aid, communal friendship and comradery, Fiji was able to preservere and stand strong. It seemed like nothing can break the Fijian spirit.🇫🇯⚡
With increasing global warming and climate change, these monster hurricanes will occur more frequently and with greater intensity.

Hope we are ready!🌬️
