For example, you see that the extremely well-ordered and finely embroidered shirts, one over the other and one within the other, which are clothed on the earth from the species of #animals and #plants, are adorned and decked out from top to bottom with purposes and instances of #wisdom, and you know that the #earth revolves and is turned like an ecstatic Mevlevi in perfect order within most exalted aims. How is it then, as an #atheist published, they suppose the death-tainted events of the earth, like the #earthquake,  which resembles the earth's shaking off itself the weight of certain forms of #heedlessness of which it disapproves from #mankind, and especially from the #believers, to be without purpose and the result of chance? How is it that they show the grievous losses of all those stricken to be without recompense and to have gone for nothing, and cast them into a fearsome #despair ? They are both making a great #error and perpetrating a great #wrong. Indeed, such events occur at the command of One All-#Wise and All-#Compassionate, in order to transform the transient property of the believers into the equivalent of alms, and make it permanent. And they are atonement for their sins arising from ingratitude for bounties.
