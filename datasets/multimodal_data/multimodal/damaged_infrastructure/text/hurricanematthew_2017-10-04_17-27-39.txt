One year ago Hurricane Matthew hit Plaisance du said, Haiti. 
Roofs were torn off, houses were smashed to the ground and the floodwaters covered the roads and went into homes.

Many houses still sit without roofs and people are still living with friends or family. Life was already tough for most of the families here. Now, the overwhelming task of rebuilding seems so daunting. After they feed their families and send a child to school, there is nothing left. 
Since the hurricane, Foundation Guillaume has been able to have 6 houses built for 6 amazing families in our community. We are grateful to those who have partnered with us to make this happen! 
Please continue to pray for our community. 30,000 people call this area home and the needs are never ending.
