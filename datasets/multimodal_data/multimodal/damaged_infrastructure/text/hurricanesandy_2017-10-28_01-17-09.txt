With the anniversary of #hurricanesandy approaching I've been going through some old pics..ðŸ™Œ After the water receded  myself and @yogadee07 decided to check out our neighborhood and see what the damage was like..every block was like this.Here's beach 92st.Twisted pieces of boardwalk everywhere and people were looting all up and down Rockaway Beach Blvd.I never want to go through this again!ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ #zonea #remember #neverforget #tb #destruction #rebuild  #5years #sandy #fusandy #community #photographer #bsa #blacksurfingassociation #rockawaybeach #newyorkcity
