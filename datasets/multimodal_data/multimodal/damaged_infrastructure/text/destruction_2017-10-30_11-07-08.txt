On October 30th 2016 at 7.40 in the morning an earthquake of magnitudo 6.5 destroys definitively what remained in the center of Italy after the previous earthquakes. It's been a year. Millions of tons of ruins nip in the bud any kind of reconstruction. Half a milion of italians are still forced to face destruction. Estimated damages of eight billion. Numbers. Behind the numbers there are people who resist, who do not give up, who are desperately trying to restart and to rebuild. They are left alone. Because the state government is not there. I had promised that I would not have forgotten and so I did. My thoughts have been with you every single day. Marchigiani. Abruzzesi. Umbri. I will always be with you.
