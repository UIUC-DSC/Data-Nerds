Helping uncover the foundation of homes from the rubble in Langtang. This was taken in May 2016. There is still a lot of work to do! They have had no homes for 16 months. Why not do something amazing with your trip? Come do a relief trek with us and make a difference in other people's lives! You've been given a lot, give back a bit. #lovepeople #trek #relief #mountains #nepal #earthquakenepal #give #langtang #dogood #rebuild
