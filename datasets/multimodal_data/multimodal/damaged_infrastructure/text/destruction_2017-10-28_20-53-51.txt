When I was volunteering at the evacuation center people took different roles. I honestly don't know much about the people I worked with. We all just started doing stuff. The guy coordinating at the time was a fill in that lived two blocks away and managed events and concerts. Here he was managing an evac center. We all knew eachother briefly on a first name orange painters tape name tag. The group I worked with we unloaded supplies and loaded trucks heading to other centers great guys. The last day we loaded semi truck. The forklift got stuck and I went to help push it out. Some of the new fresh volunteers had alot to say, saying we'd never push it out of the ditch, well me and Greg pushed it out and finished the job. There was a flood of new volunteers and we figured we'd disband and go our separate ways. I regret not taking a photo of them.
