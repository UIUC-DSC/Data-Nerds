327 people are dead after a truck bomb exploded in one of Mogadishu's busiest intersections during a traffic jam. This resulted in the collapse of a popular nearby hotel and other buildings in the area.

This is the worst terror attack in Somali history, and has been dubbed "Somalia's 9/11". Another bomb detonated in the city's Medina District, killing 2 people.
