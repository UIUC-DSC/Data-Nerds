#FirefighterFriday 
Large scale disasters are destructive and overwhelming; often times unexpected, yet not always our darkest hour. Fire departments, hospitals, law enforcement agencies and local/state/federal governments alike, all prepare for that "once in a career disaster", but when it hits, we often realize that we're never as ready as we'd hoped. 
Here in Southern California, we anticipate wildfires, earthquakes, floods (like the one you see my colleagues and me cleaning up from in the picture above) and other coastal related emergencies. 🌊  It's rare, if ever, that we face such forces like the hurricanes or tornadoes, that the southern and eastern United States are dealing with right now. We are all praying for you over here on the West Coast 🙏🏼 #hurricaneharvey #hurricaneirma  #florida #texas  Regardless, the threat to our civilization is real, from both ends of the spectrum. Where I'm from, we work so very hard to ensure our communities are educated and prepared. From prevention teams, to emergency management officials, to community response teams (CERT) to the Red Cross, reducing our vulnerabilities yields the best chance of survival. Risk happens when we don't think about the potential. Many civilians in our populations find themselves trapped in a situation, unable to escape their predicament. 🆘 Sadly, we as first responders and medical professionals, who want nothing more than to help our fellow human beings, are held at bay until we can safely take those calculated risks to save them. We risk a lot, to save a lot.... but only when it makes sense to do so.  How do you work with your large and small scale populations to make sure they're prepared? How do you explain to them when it's appropriate expect rescue? How do you get them involved so they have ownership in their survival? 
How do YOU train for the worst?
