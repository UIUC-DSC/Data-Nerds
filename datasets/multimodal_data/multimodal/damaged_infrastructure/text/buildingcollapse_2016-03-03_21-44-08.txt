If the worst happens, it's good to know we're ready to help you...
The biggest emergency response exercise ever to take place in Europe is drawing to a close.
Over four days, rescue teams from across Europe have come together to deal with a simulated building collapse on Waterloo station.
We helped with search and rescue, incident management and communications aspects of the exercise over the four days.
