Throwback to last year. Please take a minute to learn something from this. A pal at the time gave me a lift home from work. If you are a passenger always wear a belt etc and think twice about who you let take you for a joy ride. When it goes wrong there is nothing you can do as it is out of you're controll. If you are the driver and think you are senna and can take corners way too fast just remember it's not just you're life it's the passenger's and the other innocent road users life's to. Don't be selfish save it for the right road and the right time or private property or the track. Always stick within you're own limits. Remember others can be hurt because of you're actions. Think twice stay safe.
