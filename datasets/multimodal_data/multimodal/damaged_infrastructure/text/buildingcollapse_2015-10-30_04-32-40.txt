Biking down the alley....I don't think there's anything too new about this one. Me thinks maybe 2nd floor collapsed but I haven't looked at my previous pic. Looks like it had the back pulled out maybe due to brick thrives? Or maybe a Hulk fist smash on the roof? Hard to be positive about the future of this one. #oldnorthstl #northstl #stl #stlouis #stlbrick #stlhouse #oldhouse #oldhouselove #hurthouseportrait #stlarchitecture #architecture #archi_ologie #vacantplaces #stlouisgram #buildingcollapse
