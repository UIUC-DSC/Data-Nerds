Like most of you, I've seen many images of this house that went over the edge on North Beach during hurricane Irma, but  seeing it in person today was still quite a shock. I've surfed in front of this house off and on since the eighties, when the break was dubbed "Doc's Reef" in honor of Doc Chellemi, the father of a family of surfers that lived on 14th St. There was access through a little tunnel in the palmettos that not many knew about. The sand bars came and went, but there were times when it was good and well undersurfed. I kept surfing the spot when my friends Gil and Chelle bought a house on 13th St., one block north. We continued to have fun sessions off and on through the years, often just us but occasionally joined by a few of the neighbors. I dodged downpours and lightning bolts and took the path through the palmettos today for the first time in quite a while. It ended abruptly, with a 20-foot vertical drop to a now virtually-inaccessible beach. When I looked to my left this is what I saw. I'd like to think otherwise, but I'm convinced no amount of beach renourishment or coastal armoring will ever bring this place back to what it once was, and I can't help but feel the recent hurricanes signal the end of an era along the beaches of northeast Florida... #hurricaneirma #hurricanematthew #vilanobeach #northbeach #erosion #castlesmadeofsand #climatechange #sealevelrise #livingontheedge
