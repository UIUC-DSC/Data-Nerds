The spiral staircase left from a ruined building, reminds of the davastating earthquake, which not only destroyed houses but also took thousands of people's lives.

From a documentary project I shot in the village of Marpak and surroundings, in the epicenter of the 2015 Nepali earthquake.

The village was completely destroyed during the earthquake, taking many lives and leaving people homeless. Nowdays they are living in tin temporary huts, waiting for the governmental help, which doesn't seem to come.
Despite the horrible event, most of the people I've met don't loose optimism. They smile, laugh, watch TV, children go to a temporary school... life continues and that is what matters the most now.
