Fast fashion is taking the lives of human beings and our appetites for cheap clothes are responsible. 
This picture says it all. Today we are throwing back to Bangladesh #2013 following the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory that killed over 1,100 people due to appalling working conditions, and irresponsible building standards. 
This is a stark reminder of why we need to slow our fashion down. We need to make a conscious choice to buy better quality items, less often. One that are ethically and environmentally conscious instead of trend-driven.
