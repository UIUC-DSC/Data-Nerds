On #ThisDayinHistory 1989, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area. On that day, the Bay Area was buzzing about baseball. The Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants, both local teams, had reached the World Series. The third game of the series was scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park. But, just prior to the game, a magnitude 6.9 quake rocked the San Francisco Bay region. Though the stadium withstood the shaking, other parts of the Bay Area were not as fortunate. Sixty-seven people were killed as a result of the 15-second quake, and more than 3,000 others were injured. Additionally more than $5 billion in damages were caused by the tectonic activity. In the quake’s aftermath, San Francisco and other communities enacted strict regulations requiring unreinforced masonry buildings to be retrofitted. #SanFrancisco #Earthquake #1989 #WorldSeries #quake #naturaldisaster
