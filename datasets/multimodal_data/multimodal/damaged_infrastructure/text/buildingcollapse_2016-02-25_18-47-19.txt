I was still sleepy eyed when I saw this on the news this morning and realized it was in my neighborhood and got up to shoot some photos. I couldn't figure out what happened as the building itself looked pretty much the same. When the sun finally came out, I realized that sheets of the granite-looking facade of the Verizon building tore off and fell to the streets below due to last night's blustery rainstorm. Thankfully, it happened around 1AM on a street that is usually deserted at that time and no one was hurt. #verizonbuildingcollapse #verizonbuilding #partialbuildingcollapse #buildingcollapse #verizon #stormdamage #elmhurst #queens #nyc #newyorkcity
