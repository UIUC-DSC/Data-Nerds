Please at least read... 🙏🏻 Late sunday night, early monday morning (10/08) a wildfire spread from a nearby canyon to our neighborhood in the city. Being woken up to my house shaking and taking on buring embers we had minutes to get out of the house let alone the neighborhood (coffey park). I feel so lucky to be alive but unfortunately have lost everything. And I am just ONE of the many. Anything helps and I am more than grateful for even just sharing my link #tubbsfire #prayforsonomacounty #sonomaproud #pleasehelp #naturaldisaster 〰️ LINK IN BIO 〰️ #fundraising #giveback #philanthropy #dogood #causes #donate #disaster #charity #wildfire
