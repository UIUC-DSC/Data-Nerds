Hurricane Sandy. I can't believe it has been 5 years!! The damage to NJ was horrible, but the damage to my childhood town Tottenville, Staten Island was devastating. ðŸ’” I volunteered every weekend. I slept in my freezing car friday & sat nights. I met some amazing people volunteering. ðŸ’™ The first picture is of Rockaway St, the bottom right house was the first house I lived in. They only had flooding. The yellow restaurant next to it was the Rockaway Cove, it was the closest to the beach, where I would always drink Shirley Temples. The top house became a nationwide known picture during Sandy. Their granddaughter Cindy was in my grade & their 2 sons Phil & Tony were good friends of my dad.  Yetman Ave was the next block. My cousins Craig & Mark used to live by the house that was swept away where the 14 y/o Angela & her father were killed. The picture of their stairs was all that was left. The house on Yetman which became the volunteer house, was where 2 girls I worshiped growing up lived & my cousin Billy ended up marrying Sue. It was amazing seeing people dropping off goods, local donations & people drove from all over the country. People would drop off pictures & things they found. The one picture is a girl I went to elementary & middle school with. That gave me chills. Someone gave us tulips & they lasted months. A few months later I volunteered with Starbucks at the other end of the Island. My heart still breaks. #SandyYouBrokeOurHearts #HurricaneSandy #Tottenville #StatenIsland #NY #PS1 #IS34 #RockawayStreet #YetmanAve #NewJersey #Starbucks
