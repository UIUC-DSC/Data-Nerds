Spring 2017 So this is a Chevy Lumina we have on some land my family owns in Iowa. If I remember correctly my dad got it for free a little over 10 years ago and it was in really good shape. All it needed was a head gasket. However, instead of fixing that cheap gasket and selling it, he gave it to my older brother and told him to tear it apart. This may seem like a tragedy and a waste, but it's kind of a beautiful tragedy. There are now plants growing in the backseat, the entire inside is covered in moss, and it's given a home to animals in the area. Life kinda works itself out.
