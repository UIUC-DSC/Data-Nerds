H U R R I C A N E  M A R I A - Category 5. #hurricanemaria #naturaldisaster .
.
Some situations in life are simply depressing and difficult, times such as these leave you helpless and in silence. Hurricane Maria slammed the Island of Dominica, West Indies causing several immediate deaths with the death toll rising and people missing. The residents of Dominica are currently suffering from its aftermath with no food, shelter, and many difficulties. All we can do is console their loss and support them emotionally and financially. .
This magnanimous Category 5 Storm destroyed my beautiful Campus along with many other places close to my heart where I had been attending medical school for approximately 2 years happily. Ross University School of Medicine is completely destroyed, gratefully there are no student, staff, and faculty casualties. #dominicastrong #dominicastrongüá©üá≤ #dominica .

I am grateful to have lived through this horrific experience in the most comforting way possible. I stand before you today as Category 5 Hurricane Survivor. .#alhamdulillah #alhamdulillahforeverything‚ù§Ô∏è .
