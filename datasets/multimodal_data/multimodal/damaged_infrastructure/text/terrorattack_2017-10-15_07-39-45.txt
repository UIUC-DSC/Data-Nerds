Massive car bomb blast rocks Somalia's Mogadishu. At least 20 people have been killed and several others wounded in a massive truck bomb attack outside a hotel in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, police said, with officials fearing many casualties from the unusually large explosion. The blast on Saturday, in the central K5 Junction which is lined with government offices, hotels and restaurants, destroyed several buildings and set dozens of vehicles on fire. "We know that at least 20 civilians are dead while dozens of others are wounded," Abdullahi Nur, a police officer who was in the area, told Reuters news agency. "The death toll will surely rise. We are still busy transporting casualties," he said, adding that there were bodies under the rubble. #africa #somalia #hornofafrica #eastafrica #afrika #mogadishu #carbomb #explosion #terrorattack #terrorism
