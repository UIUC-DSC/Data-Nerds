#Darjeeling #BuildingCollapse Update: CLOSE TO 12 HOURS HAVE PASSED, PEOPLE STILL MISSING

It has been a long night of struggle for people here in Dr. Zakir Hussain Busty (Butcher busty). As the time passes by, the hopes of finding those missing alive fades.

The army and disaster management teams are doing their best to find those missing, but they are yet to make significant progress since the last successful rescue of Allauddin.

Four original residents and speculated two more guests are still missing.

The GTA Chief arrived early today, and has monitored the rescue efforts, tension evident in his face, reflective of the tension that entire Darjeeling feels today.

Please do PRAY that those missing may be found soon. [Sriju Bal Tamang for TheDC]
