Data Dictionary:

| Table | Attribute Name | Description | Datatype |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | record_# | Record number | Numeric |
|  | date | Date data was recorded | Date |
| Wildfire | latitude | Latitude of location where satellite data was acquired | Numeric |
| Wildfire | longitude | Longitude of location where satellite data was acquired | Numeric |
| Wildfire | satellite | Name of the satellite that acquired data | Text |
| Wildfire | avg_frp | Average Fire Radiative Power; measurement of heat energy released from fire, or strength, in Megawatts (MW) | Numeric |
|  | surface_temp | Surface temperature of location where satellite data was acquired | Numeric |
| Wildfire | confidence | This attribute represents the algorithmic confidence level that a pixel is a fire pixel. The confidence range is between 0 and 100, with 100 being the highest confidence. A higher confidence level indicates that the pixel is more likely to be a fire pixel. | Numeric |
| Wildfire | fire_count | Number of fires in a day | Numeric |
| Weather | max_temp | Maximum temperature recorded for a day | Numeric |
| Weather | rain | Rain levels of a day measured in inches | Numeric |
| Weather | city | Name of city in which data was collected | Text |


Data Schema:
![alt text](https://github.com/UIUC-DSC/Data-Nerds/blob/main/Data_Schema.png)

Ideas:
meteorology (climate data)
Details on global temperatures
Extreme weather patterns
Healthcare
COVID-19 data
Hospitalization rate
Prevalence of infectious diseases over history
Agriculture
Biology
Genetics(?)
Detecting/predicting diseases


Questions (general)
What trends have been occuring in the dataset?
What is the significance of this data / topic?
Meteorology
What do changing weather patterns mean for the climate?
What geographic areas are at high risk for (damage)?
Why are weather patterns important?
Are we trying to predict using a machine learning model? Or a regression model

Data sets we might use:

Kushiâ€™s advice:
Analyze issues coming from climate change
What areas are more higher risk?
Combining data might be important for this project
Maybe narrow down a geographic area (based on most impacted areas)
Maybe predict future data

Goals:
Find / finalize data set
Define project scope
Find region to focus on

Try to look for:
Areas most affected by climate change (lighter color is more affected)
Climate Change Impacts on California
