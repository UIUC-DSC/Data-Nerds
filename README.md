Ideas: 
meteorology (climate data)
Details on global temperatures
Extreme weather patterns 
Healthcare 
COVID-19 data 
Hospitalization rate 
Prevalence of infectious diseases over history
Agriculture 
Biology 
Genetics(?)
detecting/predicting diseases 
- Sports/entertainment  

Questions (general)
	What trends have been occuring in the dataset?
	What is the significance of this data / topic?
Meteorology
What do changing weather patterns mean for the climate?
What geographic areas are at high risk for (damage)?
Why are weather patterns important? 
Are we trying to predict using a machine learning model? Or a regression model

Kushiâ€™s advice:
Analyze issues coming from climate change
What areas are more higher risk?
Combining data might be important for this project
Maybe narrow down a geographic area (based on most impacted areas)
Maybe predict future data

Goals
Find / finalize data set
Define project scope
Find region to focus on 

Areas most affected by climate change (lighter color is more affected)
